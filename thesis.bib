Cotton simulation models have been applied during last and current decades for the analysis of the cotton plant responses to drought, heat, and nutrients stress as well as to test the alternating optimum sowing window under climate warming trend in cotton belt. Cotton growth models are useful research tools in worldwide. Mostly cotton models were applied for climatic changes, cotton management practices, and irrigation strategies on lint and cottonseed yield in worldwide. All cotton models were successfully used at local, regional, and national levels in worldwide, but among all cotton growth models, CROPGRO-Cotton model was mostly used by researchers and policy makers. For irrigation management strategies, mostly AquaCrop model was used by researchers.},

  abstract = {The appropriate level of spatial resolution for climate scenarios is a key uncertainty in climate impact studies and regional integrated assessments. To the extent that such uncertainty may affect the magnitude of economic estimates of climate change, it has implications for the public policy debates concerning the efficiency of CO2 control options. In this article, we investigate the effects that different climate scenario resolutions have on economic estimates of the impacts of future climate changeon agriculture in the United States. These results are derived via a set of procedures and an analytical model that has been used previously in climate change assessments. The results demonstrate that the spatial scale of climate scenarios affects the estimates of both regional changes in crop yields and the economic impact on the agricultural sector as a whole. An assessment based on the finer scale climatological information consistently yielded a less favorable assessment of the implications of climate change. Regional indicators of economic activity were of opposite sign in some regions, based on the scenario scale. Such differences in economic magnitudes or signs are potentially important in examining whether past climate change assessments may misstate the economic consequences of such changes. The results reported here suggest that refinement of the spatial scale of scenarios should be carefully considered in future impacts research.},

  abstract = {Crop nutrient management is an essential component of any cropping system. With increasing concerns over environmental protection, improvement in fertilizer use efficiencies has become a prime goal in global agriculture system. Phosphorus (P) is one of the most important nutrients, and strategies are required to optimize its use in important arable crops like cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) that has great significance. Sustainable P use in crop production could significantly avoid environmental hazards resulting from over-P fertilization. Crop growth modeling has emerged as an effective tool to assess and predict the optimal nutrient requirements for different crops. In present study, Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) sub-model CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton-P was evaluated to estimate the observed and simulated P use in two cotton cultivars grown at three P application rates under the semi-arid climate of southern Punjab, Pakistan. The results revealed that both the cultivars performed best at medium rate of P application (57~kg~ha-1) in terms of days to anthesis, days to maturity, seed cotton yield, total dry matter production, and harvest index during 2013 and 2014. Cultivar FH-142 performed better than MNH-886 in terms of different yield components. There was a good agreement between observed and simulated days to anthesis (0 to 1~day), days to maturity (0 to 2~days), seed cotton yield, total dry matter, and harvest index with an error of -4.4 to 15\%, 12\textendash 7.5\%, and 13\textendash 9.5\% in MNH-886 and for FH-142, 4\textendash 16\%, 19\textendash 11\%, and 16\textendash 8.3\% for growing years 2013 and 2014, respectively. CROPGRO-Cotton-P would be a useful tool to forecast cotton yield under different levels of P in cotton production system of the semi-arid climate of Southern Punjab.},

  abstract = {Unique, variable summer climate of the lower Mississippi (MS) Delta region poses a critical challenge to cotton producers in deciding when to plant for optimized production. Traditional 2\textendash 4 year agronomic field trials conducted in this area fail to capture the effects of long-term climate variabilities in the location for developing reliable planting windows for producers. Our objective was to integrate a four-year planting-date field experiment conducted at Stoneville, MS during 2005\textendash 2008 with long-term climate data in an agricultural system model and develop optimum planting windows for cotton under both irrigated and rainfed conditions. Weather data collected at this location from 1960 to 2015 and the CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton v4.6 model within the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) were used. The cotton model was able to simulate both the variable planting date and variable water regimes reasonably well: relative errors of seed cotton yield, aboveground biomass, and leaf area index (LAI) were 14\%, 12\%, and 21\% under rainfed conditions and 8\%, 16\%, and 15\% under irrigated conditions, respectively. Planting windows under both rainfed and irrigated conditions extended from mid-March to mid-June: windows from mid-March to the last week of May under rainfed conditions, and from the last week of April to the end of May under irrigated conditions were better suited for optimum yield returns. Within these windows, rainfed cotton tends to lose yield from later plantings, but irrigated cotton benefits; however, irrigation requirements increase as the planting windows advance in time. Irrigated cotton produced about 1000 kg{$\cdot$}ha-1 seed cotton more than rainfed cotton, with irrigation water requirements averaging 15 cm per season. Under rainfed conditions, there is a 5\%, 14\%, and 27\% chance that the seed cotton production is below 1000, 1500, and 2000 kg{$\cdot$}ha-1, respectively. Information developed in this paper can help MS farmers in decision support for cotton planting.},

APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) is one such model that continues to be applied and adapted to this challenging research agenda. From its inception twenty years ago, APSIM has evolved into a framework containing many of the key models required to explore changes in agricultural landscapes with capability ranging from simulation of gene expression through to multi-field farms and beyond. Keating et~al. (2003) described many of the fundamental attributes of APSIM in detail. Much has changed in the last decade, and the APSIM community has been exploring novel scientific domains and utilising software developments in social media, web and mobile applications to provide simulation tools adapted to new demands. This paper updates the earlier work by Keating et~al. (2003) and chronicles the changing external challenges and opportunities being placed on APSIM during the last decade. It also explores and discusses how APSIM has been evolving to a ``next generation'' framework with improved features and capabilities that allow its use in many diverse topics.},

Simulated values of days to anthesis, maturity, dry matter, and yield by model were reliable with recorded data. Seasonal analysis showed 23.0, 4.2, and 14.9\% yield reduction at Faisalabad, Sahiwal, and Multan, respectively under future changing climate. Strategy analysis showed that May sown of cultivar FH-142 at Faisalabad and Sahiwal and MNH-886 at Multan with 200 kg N ha-1 can be a viable option to get maximum yield. The DSSAT module for Cotton Crop Modeling has been widely evaluated as a tool to predict the effect of climate change on productivity. A 2-yr multifactorial experiment was conducted at three locations of Pakistan (Faisalabad, Sahiwal, and Multan) to test and validate this model for dynamic simulation of growth, development, and seed-cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) yield of cultivars (3) at varying N increments (three levels) sown at two different timings (1 May and 1 June). The model was first calibrated with field data collected during 2014 based on the best performing treatment (May sown and 200 kg N ha-1). Data of year 2015 was then used for further validation. Modeled values of various phenological attributes (e.g., days to anthesis and maturity) by model were reliable with recorded data, having root mean square error (RMSE) less than 2 d during both years. The RMSE values for total dry matter and seed-cotton yield were reasonably good (278\textendash 573 kg ha-1 and 237\textendash 422 kg ha-1, respectively). Applying 1980 to 2015 climate histories for the three regions, we found Faisalabad to be vulnerable up to 23.0\% reduction of yield followed by Multan (14.9\%), whereas the Sahiwal region is modeled as much more resilient, with less than 5\% predicted reductions in yield. Finally, we found that strategic cultivar choice and timing of planting can alleviate many of the adverse impacts of changing climates on cotton yield. We conclude that the DSSAT model can be effective as a tool to make strategic cotton planting choices under changing climates.},

Our objective was to study cotton yield, water use efficiency (WUE), and economic returns responses to irrigation, which included a combination of six evapotranspiration (ET) replacement levels (40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 140\% ET) and four irrigation durations (4, 6, 8, and 10 wk). The model was initially calibrated and validated using field data. Calibrated model was then used to run simulation scenarios. Maximum lint yield of 1838 kg ha\textendash 1 was obtained by irrigating at 111\% ET for 10 wk while maximum WUE of 2.65 kg ha\textendash 1 mm\textendash 1 was obtained by irrigating at 85\% ET for 8 wk or 96\% ET for 10 wk. This maximum lint yield required 530 mm of irrigation and 880 mm of total water. Maximum economic returns of US\$1610 ha\textendash 1 was obtained with 516 mm of irrigation water. However, if this amount of water is not available for irrigation, deficit irrigation at 85\% ET for 8 wk is a good alternative strategy as it produced 1560 kg lint ha\textendash 1 and \$1240 ha\textendash 1 economic returns with improved WUE. Our results indicate that scheduling irrigation by considering cotton ET demand could increase lint yield, WUE, and profit in the Texas Rolling Plains.},

This chapter presents a critical review of the current seasonal crop yield forecasting methods found in the scientific literature. Extensive research has been conducted on crop yield forecast, particularly for wheat, maize, rice, barley, and soybean. Yield forecast are mainly based on field surveys, statistical regressions between historical yield and in-season variables (agrometeorological, or remotely sensed data), crop simulation models, or on integration between statistical modeling with dynamic process-based crop simulation models. A low number of studies rely on field surveys as a means to forecast yield, but they remain the main methods of yield forecast and estimation in several countries (i.e., USA). This chapter aims to report results found in peer-review journals for different crops, methods, geographies, and accuracies, and to end with a critical perspective on the advantage and disadvantage of the different methods currently employed by researchers and stakeholders.},

Our objectives were to (i) evaluate irrigation capacity and duration effects on lint yield, and (ii) compare application strategies that maximize yield and WUE. The simulation model GOSSYM was used with 1959 to 2000 weather records from Bushland, TX, to calculate yields of cotton grown on a Pullman clay loam (fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Torrertic Paleustoll) with 50 or 100\% initial available soil water. We compared all combinations of irrigation duration (4, 6, 8, and 10 wk) and capacity (for ET replacement of 2.5, 3.75, and 5.0 mm d-1 and dryland). Simulated lint yield decreased as irrigation decreased; however, yields for similar irrigation totals increased with increasing irrigation capacity. Simulated yields for cotton irrigated {$>$} 8 wk did not differ among irrigation capacities, but cotton irrigated at 5.0 mm d-1 maintained yield with earlier irrigation termination at 6 wk. Based on mean yields, we determined that spreading water to deficit irrigate a field with 2.5 mm d-1 yielded \textasciitilde 5\% less lint than concentrating that water to irrigate smaller fields at 3.75 or 5.0 mm d-1 that were averaged with complementary (2:1 and 1:1) dryland areas.},

Our objective was to compare cotton yield response to irrigation as altered by La Ni\~na, Neutral, or El Ni\~no phases for the Texas High Plains.

Simulated lint yield and its ratio to evapotranspiration generally decreased with emergence delays and increased with increasing irrigation amount and application rate. Growing season precipitation varied with ENSO phase, but April to June phase classification was inconsistent with fall conditions except for La Ni\~na. Compared with yield estimates for Neutral and El Ni\~no phases, limited rain during La Ni\~na years reduced lint yields from 5 to 30\% when initial soil water was 75 and 50\%. Yield increased with increasing irrigation rate and duration during drier La Ni\~na growing seasons, but irrigation benefits decreased during Neutral and El Ni\~no years having greater precipitation. Early ENSO based extended forecasts for La Ni\~na related consistently to irrigation effects on yield and could determine application strategies.}

Landscape-scale cotton models could track these interactions and be integrated into future decision support tools designed to manage variable inputs; however, modeling of cotton systems across the landscape has not been evaluated. Cotton production in the Southern Texas High Plains is dependent on irrigation from the Ogallala Aquifer, and thus tracking soil water content across fields could help producers plan their use of diminishing aquifer resources. Our hypothesis was that the PALMScot model, a grid-based landscape-scale cotton model, would capture spatial and temporal variability and environmental interactions affecting soil water and plant growth within a 70-ha field throughout two contrasting growing seasons, without adjustment of input parameters for the model. Thus, our objective was to compare values of soil water content and crop height calculated by the PALMScot model with corresponding field measured values at multiple locations across a fine textured, pivot irrigated production cotton field during two growing seasons. The PALMScot model calculated values of soil water and crop height across the field with a root mean squared deviation (RMSD) for soil water content in the 1.0-m profile {$\leq$}0.032~m3/m3 and most Nash\textendash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values {$\geq$}0.48. Values of RMSD for crop height were {$\leq$}0.10~m at all locations in 2010 and 2011. We conclude that PALMScot correctly and efficiently calculated soil water content and crop height across the field, throughout each season, and the model has potential as a site-specific management tool for cotton cropping systems.}

  abstract = {作物生长模拟模型和管理决策支持系统是信息农业和数字农业研究与应用的核心与典范。作物生长模拟模型具有系统综合和动态预测的功能，但至今尚缺乏对作物品质形成过程的定量模拟，基于模拟模型的作物管理决策支持系统能够通过模拟试验，实现系统管理的策略分析和方案评估。本研究以棉花为研究对象，在本实验室已有棉花生长发育和产量品质形成模拟模型的基础上，运用系统分析原理和数学建模技术，综合了棉花器官建成与蕾铃脱落、棉铃干物质积累分配、纤维品质的形成与环境因子的动态关系，建立了基于棉花生理发育时间(PDT)的生育期模拟模型、基于生理生态过程的棉花器官建成和蕾铃脱落模拟模型、单铃干物质积累分配模拟模型、纤维品质时空分布模拟模型。应用面向对象的程序设计与软构件技术，在Visual C++平台上构建了综合性与构件化的棉花生长发育和产量品质形成的模拟系统；进一步运用决策支持技术，结合基于不同目标的模拟试验与策略分析，研制了具有辅助决策功能的基于生长模型的棉花管理决策支持系统。研究结果为当今数字化农作系统的开发提供了基本框架，也为建立其它作物管理决策支持系统提供了开发模式。具体研究结果如下： 	(1)系统分析了不同肥料、不同密度试验棉花生育与环境因素之间的动态关系，综合考虑了热效应(RTE)、光周期效应(RPE)、品种早熟性(VE)，建立了以PDT为驱动变量的棉花生育期模拟模型；在充分考虑氮素营养、土壤水分胁迫、DPC调控等对棉花生育的影响基础上，构建了棉花器官建成和蕾铃脱落模拟模型。利用不同年份、品种和播期的试验资料对上述模型进行了检验。结果表明，棉花生育期模拟值与观测值间的均方差根(RMSE)为0.80～1.65，吻合度较好，精度较高；叶片数、株高、果枝数、果节数、脱落数、成铃数的模拟值与观察值间的RMSE值分别为0.36叶、1.11cm、0.57台、2.87个、1.00个、0.59个，模拟误差小于3％，具有较高的模拟精度，适应性较好。 	(2)在系统分析不同基因型、施肥量、开花期棉铃干物质积累与分配动态规律的基础上，以RTE为驱动变量，在综合考虑了氮素营养、水分胁迫、同化物供需比等对棉铃的生长发育主要影响因子的前提下，建立了基于RTE的棉花单铃干物质积累分配的分期动态模型；模拟检验结果显示，棉花四桃(伏前桃、伏桃、早秋桃、晚秋桃)单铃、籽棉、纤维干物质积累的RMSE值分别为0.1767～0.5659、0.0725～0.5279、0.0613～0.2634g，而单一综合模拟模型的RMSE值超过或接近分期模拟模型相对应的RMSE值的上限。因此，分期模拟棉铃干物质的积累与分配比单一综合模拟模型预测效果要准确、可靠。 	(3)在系统分析棉花花铃期的温度、光照、水分胁迫、氮素营养等主要因子对棉花纤维品质影响的基础上，量化了棉花品种、棉株空间不同枝节和花铃期的日均温、光照长度、土壤含水量、棉株含氮率对棉花纤维品质指标形成的影响，并结合已有的棉花纤维品质指标的生态模型，构建了机理性较强的预测纤维长度、比强度、麦克隆值、长度整齐度的单一纤维品质指标的时空分布模型和综合模型，利用不同年份、品种类型、生态区域、肥水管理条件下的试验资料对棉花纤维品质指标的时空分布模型进行了检验。检验结果表明，纤维长度、比强度、麦克隆值、长度整齐度的RMSE值，在时间分布模型中分别为0.15mm、0.29cN{$\cdot$}tex\textasciitilde (-1)、0.18和0.36，在空间分布模型中分别为0.22mm、0.60cN{$\cdot$}tex\textasciitilde (-1)和0.15和0.86，与实际观察值间的误差皆小于5％，说明模型具有较好的预测性、通用性和准确性。 	(4)以棉花生长发育为主线，采用面向对象的程序设计和软构件技术，结合气象数据生成模型和品种参数调试模型，构建了机理性和解释性较强的棉花生长模拟模型(CottonGrow)及棉花生长模拟系统(CGSS)。该系统主要包括生育进程、器官建成及形态发生、光合生产、物质分配、水分和养分平衡、产量与品质形成等模块，可以定量预测不同生态环境、生产条件和品种类型下的棉花生长发育过程和生产力形成动态。 	(5)在构建棉花生长模拟系统的基础上，结合基于不同目标的模拟试验及基于模型结果的策略分析评价模型，并充分利用软构件的语言无关性、可重性、简便快捷的系统维护机制等特点，在VC++与VB平台上构建了机理性、通用性、应用性等较强的棉花管理决策支持系统(GMDSSCM)，实现了模型的预测功能、决策支持功能和人机交互技术的有机耦合，可以为不同生态环境、生产条件和品种类型推荐适宜的棉花生产管理方案。GMDSSCM成功的研制，为今后数字棉作系统的研制奠定了基础。},

  abstract = {Limited water supplies for agriculture in the Texas High Plains will require new irrigation technologies and techniques for agriculture to continue in this area. The potential for using one such technology, site-specific irrigation, was evaluated using the Cotton2k crop simulation model. This model and two other simulation models were evaluated for their ability to track water movement and usage over three growing seasons. The models were tested for sites in Lubbock and Hale County, Texas. Cotton2k performed well compared to the other two models on tests of cumulative evapotranspiration and applied water yield relations and equal to the other models for tracking soil water profiles. A global optimization method, simulated annealing, was tested for its ability to spatially calibrate soil water parameters of Cotton2k. The algorithm found multiple parameter sets for the same objective function results. This result runs contrary to expectations for the simulated annealing algorithm, but is possibly from the relationship between available water capacity and crop yield. The annealing algorithm was applied to each sampling point at the Hale County site and improved yield predictions for 32 of 33 points as compared to simulations made with soil textural information alone. The spatially calibrated model was used with historic weather from five seasons to evaluate a site-specific strategy where water was shifted from lower to higher yielding areas of fields. Two irrigation strategies, one with irrigations weekly and one with irrigations applied when 30\% of available water was depleted, were tested. With sitespecific management, the weekly interval strategy produced higher yields for two of three water levels, as compared to uniform management. With the soil moisture depletion strategy, site-specific management produced lower yields than uniform management for all three water levels examined. Yield improvement and water savings were also demonstrated for implementing site-specific irrigation when non-producing portions of fields were previously being watered.},

  abstract = {1 The theories of Grime and Tilman are ambitious attempts to unify disparate theories regarding the construction of plants, their interaction with the environment and the assembly of communities. After over two decades of parallel research, their ideas have not been reconciled, hindering progress in understanding the functioning of ecosystems. 2 Grime's theories do not adequately incorporate the importance of non-heterogeneous supplies of nutrients and how these supplies are partitioned over long time scales, are inconsistent regarding the importance of disturbance in nutrient-limited habitats and need to reconsider the carbon economy of shade-tolerant plants. 3 Failure to account for differences between aquatic and terrestrial systems in how resource supplies are partitioned led Tilman to develop a shifting set of theories that have become reduced in mechanistic detail over time. The most recent highlighted the reduction of nutrient concentrations in soil solution, although it can no longer be derived from any viable mechanistic model. The slow diffusion of nutrients in soils means that the reduction of average soil solution nutrient concentrations cannot explain competitive exclusion. 4 Although neither theory, nor a union of the two, adequately characterizes the dynamics of terrestrial plant assemblages, the complementarity in their assumptions serve as an important foundation for future theory and research. 5 Reconciling the approaches of Grime and Tilman leads to six scenarios for competition for nutrients and light, with the outcome of each depending on the ability of plants to pre-empt supplies. Under uniform supplies, pulses or patches, light competition requires leaf area dominance, while nutrient competition requires root length dominance. There are still important basic questions regarding the nature of nutrient supplies that will need to be answered, but recent research brings us closer to a unified set of theories on resource competition.},

It is proved that this method is independent of the relative scales of the functions and is successful in producing an evenly distributed set of points in the Pareto set given an evenly distributed set of parameters, a property which the popular method of minimizing weighted combinations of objective functions lacks. Further, this method can handle more than two objectives while retaining the computational efficiency of continuation-type algorithms. This is an improvement over continuation techniques for tracing the trade-off curve since continuation strategies cannot easily be extended to handle more than two objectives.},

  abstract = {The WOFOST cropping systems model has been applied operationally over the last 25 years as part of the MARS crop yield forecasting system. In this paper we provide an updated description of the model and reflect on the lessons learned over the last 25 years. The latter includes issues like system performance, model sensitivity, spatial model setup, parameterization and calibration approaches as well as software implementation and version management. Particularly for spatial model calibrations we provide experience and guidelines on how to execute calibrations and how to evaluate WOFOST model simulation results, particularly under conditions of limited field data availability. As an open source model WOFOST has been a success with at least 10 different implementations of the same concept. An overview is provided for those implementations which are managed by MARS or Wageningen groups. However, the proliferation of WOFOST implementations has also led to questions on the reproducibility of results from different implementations as is demonstrated with an example from MARS. In order to certify that the different WOFOST implementations and versions available can reproduce basic sets of inputs and outputs we make available a large set of test cases as appendix to this publication. Finally, new methodological extensions have been added to WOFOST in simulating the impact of nutrients limitations, extreme events and climate variability. Also, a difference is made in the operational and scientific versions of WOFOST with different licensing models and possible revenue generation. Capitalizing both on academic development as well as model testing in real-world situations will help to enable new applications of the WOFOST model in precision agriculture and smart farming.}

A method was developed for the calculation of diurnal patterns of air temperature, wind speed, global radiation and relative humidity from available daily data. Calculated data were validated with measured data collected in Israel, California and The Netherlands. A simple sine-exponential method for describing diurnal air temperature was not sufficient in most cases, and the addition of parameters which specified the time lag of maximum temperature and the effect of buoyancy improved the data accuracy. Diurnal course of wind speed could be described using two sine curves scaled by the measured daily total wind run. Time base of each of the sine curves and the minimum wind speed had to be defined for each location. An accurate description of the diurnal global radiation was obtained, based on the measured daily total global radiation, and the calculated sine of the solar elevation corrected for atmospheric transmissivity. Relative humidity was calculated from the dew point temperature computed as the minimum value of a characteristic seasonal value or the actual air temperature. When the site-specific parameters were known or correctly estimated these methods gave good estimations of the diurnal weather patterns.},

The paper proposed a county-scale cotton mapping method by using random forest (RF) feature selection algorithm and classifier based on selecting multi-features, including spectral, vegetation indices, and texture features. The contribution of texture features to cotton classification accuracy was also explored in addition to spectral features and vegetation index. In addition, the optimal classification time, feature importance, and the best classifier on the cotton extraction accuracy were evaluated. The results showed that the texture feature named the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is effective for improving classification accuracy, ranking second in contribution among all studied spectral, VI, and texture features. Among the three classifiers, the RF showed higher accuracy and better stability than support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The average overall accuracy (OA) of the classification combining multiple features was 93.36\%, 7.33\% higher than the average OA of the single-time spectrum, and 2.05\% higher than the average OA of the multi-time spectrum. The classification accuracy after feature selection by RF can still reach 92.12\%, showing high accuracy and efficiency. Combining multiple features and random forest methods may be a promising county-scale cotton classification method.},

Finding optimal irrigation and water resources for crops is necessary to increase the efficiency of water usage. Many optimization approaches maximize crop yield or profit but do not consider the impact on the environment. We propose a machine learning approach based on the crop simulation model WOFOST to assess the crop yield and water use efficiency. In our research, we use weather history to evaluate various weather scenarios. The application of multi-criteria optimization based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) allows users to find the dates and volume of water for irrigation, maximizing the yield and reducing the total water consumption. In the study case, we compared the effectiveness of NSGA-II with Monte Carlo search and a real farmer's strategy. We showed a decrease in water consumption simultaneously with increased sugar-beet yield using the NSGA-II algorithm. Our approach yielded a higher potato crop than a farmer with a similar level of water consumption. The NSGA-II algorithm received an increase in yield for potato crops, but water use efficiency remained at the farmer's level. NSGA-II used water resources more efficiently than the Monte Carlo search and reduced water losses to the lower soil horizons.},

A SOM\textendash residue module from the CENTURY model was incorporated in the DSSAT crop simulation models, and a residue layer was added on top of the soil. Modifications were also made in the senescence module of CROPGRO, a model within DSSAT, so that senesced material is now added daily to the soil. Evaluation of the model, using a data set of 40 yr of bare fallow, showed an excellent fit [product moment correlation coefficient (r) of 0.983] between simulated and measured values for SOM-C. Soil N from decomposing SOM and residues was evaluated with data from a Brazilian experiment with seven leguminous residue types. By incorporating the CENTURY SOM\textendash residue module, DSSAT crop simulation models have become more suitable for simulating low-input systems and conducting long-term sustainability analyses.},

  abstract = {Climate changes, associated with accumulation of greenhouse gases, are expected to have a profound influence on agricultural sustainability in Israel, a semi-arid area characterized by a cold wet winter and a dry warm summer. Accordingly this study explored economic aspects of agricultural production under projected climate-change scenarios by the ``production function'' approach, as applied to two representative crops: wheat, as the major crop grown in Israel's dry southern region, and cotton, representing the more humid climate in the north. Adjusting outputs of the global climate model HadCM3 to the specific research locations, we generated projections for 2070\textendash 2100 temperatures and precipitations for two climate change scenarios. Results for wheat vary among climate scenarios; net revenues become negative under the severe scenario (change from -145 to -273\%), but may increase under the moderate one (-43 to +35\%), depending on nitrogen applied to the crop. Distribution of rain events was found to play a major role in determining yields. By contrast, under both scenarios cotton experiences a considerable decrease in yield with significant economic losses (-240 and -173\% in A2 and B2 scenarios, respectively). Additional irrigation and nitrogen may reduce farming losses, unlike changes in seeding dates.},

The function describing the processes in the fruiting model were made sensitive to solar radiation, water and nitrogen stress and water logging. A leaf area generator, a boll growth model and an elementary nitrogen model were added. The model was validated against six data sets from agronomic experiments over a period of 30 years covering the range of Australian cotton growing regions from 15\textdegree{} to 34\textdegree S. The model responded to climatic and agronomic (irrigation regime, nitrogen fertiliser rate and sowing date) variables at all sites, and without bias at 5 out of 6; a difference in soil type probably caused the bias at one site. Decision support needs dictated development of the model, which is no more complex than needed to supply information for management decisions. The project demonstrates that such a `top down' approach can produce a simple yet powerful simulator.},

Because Tennessee is on the edge of the Cotton Belt, and has growing conditions different from the states where the model was originally used, researchers expected the model to perform differently here. Researchers found that the model's accuracy varied. Each modification improved its predictions for additional fertilization, but yield predictions were erratic. Tillage system had little or no effect on the model's accuracy. Researchers recommend further location-based changes to help the model accurately predict crop maturity in Tennessee. Researchers returned information to the GOSSYM-COMAX Information Unit, where it was used to make the model easier to use and more accurate.

However, there is no large-scale and high-resolution method suitable for mapping cotton fields, and the problems associated with low resolution and poor timeliness need to be solved. Here, we proposed a new framework for mapping cotton fields based on Sentinel-1/2 data for different phenological periods, random forest classifiers, and the multi-scale image segmentation method. A cotton field map for 2019 at a spatial resolution of 10 m was generated for northern Xinjiang, a dominant cotton planting region in China. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the map were 0.932 and 0.813, respectively. The results showed that the boll opening stage was the best phenological phase for mapping cotton fields and the cotton fields was identified most accurately at the early boll opening stage, about 40 days before harvest. Additionally, Sentinel-1 and the red edge bands in Sentinel-2 are important for cotton field mapping, and there is great potential for the fusion of optical images and microwave images in crop mapping. This study provides an effective approach for high-resolution and high-accuracy cotton field mapping, which is vital for sustainable monitoring and management of cotton planting.},

The developed modeling scheme incorporated proximal sensing data and satellite imagery. We formulated this model and evaluated its accuracy using field datasets obtained in Lamesa in 1999, Halfway in 2002 and 2004, and Lubbock in 2003\textendash 2005 in the Texas High Plains in the USA. We found that RSCM cotton could reproduce the cotton leaf area index and lint yield across different locations and irrigation systems with a statistically significant degree of accuracy. RSCM cotton was also used to simulate cotton lint yield for the field circles in Halfway. The RSCM system could accurately reproduce the spatiotemporal variations in cotton lint yield when integrated with satellite images. From the results of this study, we predict that the proposed crop-modeling approach will be applicable for the practical monitoring of cotton growth and productivity by farmers. Furthermore, a user can operate the modeling system with minimal input data, owing to the integration of proximal and remote sensing information.},

The daily N requirements for new growth of leaves, stems, roots, burrs, and seed were calculated based on maximum and minimum N concentration for these plant parts. Daily N absorption depended on the availability of N in the soil pool and new growth requirements. If the absorbed N was less than the required amount, partitioning functions determined the distribution of available N into each sink. During periods of N shortages, some N reserves were supplied for new growth from the breakdown of N compounds in the older leaves and stems. Depending on the level of N shortage, new growth was slowed, bolls and squares were abscised, and some leaves were shed. The model shows that, based on the N balance, growth can be restricted and reproductive organs aborted after SIMCOT II runs its normal course for a day during the boll setting period. Simulated fruiting characteristics and yield curves were similar to those of real plants.},

  abstract = {The decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) has been in use for the last 15 years by researchers worldwide. This package incorporates models of 16 different crops with software that facilitates the evaluation and application of the crop models for different purposes. Over the last few years, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain the DSSAT crop models, partly due to fact that there were different sets of computer code for different crops with little attention to software design at the level of crop models themselves. Thus, the DSSAT crop models have been re-designed and programmed to facilitate more efficient incorporation of new scientific advances, applications, documentation and maintenance. The basis for the new DSSAT cropping system model (CSM) design is a modular structure in which components separate along scientific discipline lines and are structured to allow easy replacement or addition of modules. It has one Soil module, a Crop Template module which can simulate different crops by defining species input files, an interface to add individual crop models if they have the same design and interface, a Weather module, and a module for dealing with competition for light and water among the soil, plants, and atmosphere. It is also designed for incorporation into various application packages, ranging from those that help researchers adapt and test the CSM to those that operate the DSSAT\textendash CSM to simulate production over time and space for different purposes. In this paper, we describe this new DSSAT\textendash CSM design as well as approaches used to model the primary scientific components (soil, crop, weather, and management). In addition, the paper describes data requirements and methods used for model evaluation. We provide an overview of the hundreds of published studies in which the DSSAT crop models have been used for various applications. The benefits of the new, re-designed DSSAT\textendash CSM will provide considerable opportunities to its developers and others in the scientific community for greater cooperation in interdisciplinary research and in the application of knowledge to solve problems at field, farm, and higher levels.},

  abstract = {The simulation of cottonseed (Gossypium hirsutum L.) growth is still an area of great uncertainty, especially in the process of cottonseed quality formation. A simple process-based model was developed to predict cotton boll maturation period and simulate cottonseed biomass accumulation, protein, and oil content. The cotton boll maturation period module took solar radiation and N nutrition factors into account in addition to temperature and variety maturity profile. Based on the hypothesis that the accumulation of biomass, oil, and protein are mainly sink-determined, the model was developed by considering parameters of cultivar characteristics, weather (temperature and solar radiation), and crop management variables (precisely N supply). The subtending leaf N concentration of cotton boll was simulated by a new semi-empirical model, and worked as the direct indicator of the N nutrition effect on cottonseed growth and development. The model was calibrated using data obtained in experiment conducted in Nanjing (the lower reaches of Yangtze River Valley) in 2005 and 2006. The model was then tested using two field experimental data sets. One was obtained in Nanjing, China in 2007, and the other in the Yellow River Valley (Xuzhou and Anyang) and the lower reaches of Yangtze River Valley (Huaian), China in 2005. The simulated values of boll maturation period by the model were very consistent with the observed values, with root mean square error (RMSE) lower than 3 days. The RMSE of cottonseed dry weight, protein content, and oil content predictions were 8.9mgseed-1, 2.19\%, and 2.71\%, respectively. The result showed that the model is sufficiently robust to predict the cotton boll maturation period, cottonseed dry weight, and quality in wide range of conditions. It is not only a necessary component of cotton growth model, but also provides a good platform for further study in modeling cottonseed protein and oil yield.},

  abstract = {Water shortage is the main limiting factor for agricultural productivity in many countries and improving water use efficiency in agriculture has been the focus of numerous studies. The usual approach to limit water consumption in agriculture is to apply water quotas and in such a situation farmers should use an irrigation schedule that maximizes the yield and abides to the quota constraints. In contrast to the widespread use of irrigation scheduling based on agronomy practices, irrigation scheduling may be considered as a constrained optimization problem. When drip irrigation is used, the decision variables are the irrigation amounts for each day of the season. The objective function is the expected yield calculated with the use of a model. In the present work we solved this optimization problem for three crops modeled by the model AquaCrop. This optimization problem is non-trivial due to the non-smooth behavior of the objective function and the fact that it involves multiple integer variables. We developed an optimization scheme for generating sub-optimal irrigation schedules that take implicitly into account the response of the crop to water stress, and used these as initial guesses for a full optimization of daily irrigation. Performing this optimization with various values of water quotas produced the function that expresses the relationship between water quota and yield.},

  abstract = {Cotton is one of the major crops cultivated in the Texas Rolling Plains region, and it is a major contributor to the regional economy. Cotton cultivation in this region is facing severe challenges due to an increase in the frequency of droughts and a projected decrease in rainfall in the future. Development and evaluation of deficit irrigation strategies for this region could potentially conserve water while maintaining cotton yields. In this study, the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) Cropping System Model (CSM) CROPGRO-Cotton was extensively tested and then used for evaluating various deficit irrigation strategies for this region. The model inputs were obtained from field experiments conducted at Chillicothe, Texas, during four growing seasons: 2008-2010 and 2012. The model was first calibrated using the data from a 100\% evapotranspiration (ET) replacement irrigation scheduling experiment conducted in 2012 and then validated on three other irrigation scheduling treatments (75\% ET replacement, soil moisture based, and tensiometer based) conducted in the same year. The model was further evaluated using the data from cotton tillage and irrigation experiments conducted in an adjacent field during 2008-2010. The model calibration, validation, and evaluation results were satisfactory except under dry conditions (0\% ET replacement and 33\% ET replacement). Simulated maximum seed cotton yields under normal and dry weather conditions were achieved at 100\% and 110\% ET replacement, respectively. Percentage decrease in seed cotton yield was marginal (3.5\% to 8.8\%) when the amount of irrigation water applied was decreased from 100\% to 66\% ET replacement under normal rainfall conditions. However, under less than normal rainfall (drier) conditions, the percentage decrease in seed cotton yield was substantial (about 17.5\%) when the irrigation strategy was switched from 100\% to 70\% ET replacement. The simulations demonstrate that adopting deficit irrigation practices under normal weather conditions can conserve water without adversely affecting seed cotton yields. However, under dry conditions, there is a risk of increased yield loss, and therefore producers should consider that risk when adopting deficit irrigation strategies.},

In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN/sup 2/) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.},

Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm following NSGA-II framework (we call it NSGA-III) that emphasizes population members that are nondominated, yet close to a set of supplied reference points. The proposed NSGA-III is applied to a number of many-objective test problems with three to 15 objectives and compared with two versions of a recently suggested EMO algorithm (MOEA/D). While each of the two MOEA/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed NSGA-III is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this paper.

Photomicrographs of leaf cross-sections and of the leaf surfaces were scanned and analyzed with the image analysis software. The data were used to parameterize the new WALL model, developed in this study to analyze the leaf transpiration with a special emphasis to liquid water movement inside the leaf. The transpiration stream was assumed to go from vein endings in two directions, towards the upper and lower leaf surfaces. These fluxes were presented as two parallel currents driven by the water vapour concentration difference between the atmosphere and the open surface of the vein endings and on the mesophyll and epidermis (inner parts) cells' surfaces as a flow in thin films of water. Simulations were run to estimate quantitatively the contribution of the cuticular transpiration to the total amount of leaf transpiration stream, to evaluate the role of the mesophyll cell walls' surfaces in the water transfer inside the leaf, and to calculate the dependence of transpiration and its components on temperature. Simulation results showed (1) a major role of the cuticular transpiration as a leaf cooling mechanism and (2) that the cell wall properties can affect water film characteristics that also affect the transpiration course.},

The growing-season length on the Texas High Plains is less than optimal for cotton production, based upon total available heat units. In addition, water stress, due to inadequate rainfall, coupled with the high evaporative demand, represents the major environmental contraint to cotton yield. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the relationship between cotton lint yield and available heat units in this climate. When water supply was not the major limitation to productivity, lint yield was highly correlated with the available heat units during the growing season (r2=0.90). When water stress represented the major growth constraint (seasonal water supply less than 400 mm), no significant relationship existed between lint yield and seasonal heat-unit accumulation. Evaluation of the response of specific growth stages revealed that the accumulation of heat units during the early fruiting period explained as much of the yield variability as did the seasonal heat-unit accumulation.},

  abstract = {Estimation of all water fluxes temporally and spatially within and out of the crop root zone, and evaluation of issues like salinity and nutrient leaching, are necessary to fully appraise the efficiency of irrigation systems. Simulation models can be used to investigate these issues over several seasons when the cost of long term monitoring is prohibitive. Model results can be used to advise growers if improvements are required to various aspects of irrigation system operations. In this study, HYDRUS-2D was used to evaluate data measured during one season in a young mandarin (Citrus reticulata) orchard, irrigated with an intensive surface drip fertigation system. Water contents, salinities, and nitrate concentrations measured weekly in the field were compared with model predictions. The temporal mean absolute error (MAE) values between weekly measured and simulated water contents ranged from 0.01 to 0.04cm3cm-3. However, modelling error (MAE) was slightly larger at 10cm depth (0.04cm3cm-3), as compared to greater depths (0.02\textendash 0.03cm3cm-3). Similarly, the errors were larger in the surface soil layer (25cmdepth) for nitrate\textendash nitrogen, NO3-\textendash N (1.52mmol(c)L-1), as compared to greater depths. The spatial and temporal soil solution salinity (ECsw) and NO3-\textendash N data showed accumulation of salts and nitrate within the soil up until day 150 of the simulation (December, 2006), followed by leaching due to high precipitation and over irrigation at later times. Only 49\% of applied water was used by the mandarin trees, while 33.5\% was leached. On the other hand, the simulation revealed that a significant amount of applied nitrogen (85\%) was taken up by the mandarin trees, and the remaining 15\% was leached. The results indicate that the irrigation and fertigation schedule needs modifying as there was overwatering from December onwards. Different permutations and combinations of irrigation and fertigation scheduling were evaluated to optimise the water and nitrogen uptake and to reduce their leaching out of the crop root zone. Slightly higher nitrogen uptake (1.73kgha-1) was recorded when fertigation was applied second to last hour in an irrigation event, as compared to applying it earlier during an irrigation event. Similarly, a 20\% reduction in irrigation and N application produced a pronounced reduction in drainage (28\%) and N leaching (46.4\%), but it also decreased plant N uptake by 15.8\% and water uptake by 4.8\%, and increased salinity by 25.8\%, as compared to the normal practice. This management would adversely impact the sustainability of this expensive irrigation system. However, reducing only irrigation by 30\% during the 2nd half of the crop season (January to August) reduced drainage and N leaching by 37.2\% and 50.5\%, respectively, and increased N uptake by 6.9\%. Such management of irrigation would be quite promising for the sustainability of the entire system. It is concluded that judicious manipulations of irrigation and fertilizer applications can be helpful in designing drip irrigation schedules for perennial horticultural crops to achieve improved efficiency of irrigation and fertigation applications and reduced contamination of receiving water bodies.},

A general framework is suggested. Data from a number of saturated land sites and open water sites in the absence of advection suggest a widely applicable formula for the relationship between sensible and latent heat fluxes. For drying land surfaces, we assume that the evaporation rate is given by the same formula for evaporation multiplied by a factor. This factor is found to remain at unity while an amount of water, varying from one site to another, is evaporated. Following this a linear decrease sets in, reducing the evaporation rate to zero after a further 5 cm of evaporation, the same at several sites examined.},

  abstract = {Simulation models are useful tools that provide information about potential changes to production systems before committing time and resources. There are many potential uses of simulation models in providing solutions to many problems in research, crop management and policy. In this paper, we discuss GOSSYM, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) simulation model, from its inception, development, validation, applications and future development needs. GOSSYM was released to USA farmers in 1984 and since then farmers, scientists, education specialists, extension personnel, and policy makers are using GOSSYM. GOSSYM is being continuously validated across the US Cotton Belt and also in several other countries like China, Israel, Greece and Spain as new information become available. GOSSYM has wide applications, both at regional level and farm level. At the regional level, it aids in policy decisions such as climate change impact analysis, yield decline assessment, insect damage assessment, tillage and erosion assessment and cultivar/genetics improvement research. At the farm level, it aids in pre-season and in-season decisions such as land lease/purchase, genotype selection, irrigation and nitrogen management, growth regulator and harvest-aid chemical applications. A study in Greece showed that GOSSYM decision-implemented fields produced 26-81\% higher yields than farmer decisionimplemented fields. In monetary terms, studies in the USA illustrated that farmers were benefited by about \$80-350 ha-1 when decisions by GOSSYM were implemented in farmers fields. Scientists from National Center for Atmospheric Research, USA compared GOSSYM with other models like COTTAM and showed that GOSSYM was more realistic than any other models. GOSSYM has also educational applications and till date 57 Masters and Ph.D theses and dissertations were submitted to Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, Mississippi, USA with GOSSYM as a major component of research. These continuous assessments/ applications of GOSSYM since 1980s identified some knowledge voids, which have been incorporated in the model and newer versions have been released. The model simulates most of the physiological and physical processes affecting cotton growth, development and yield. The model has proven potential for increasing profitability and is being used in the USA in commercial farm management. The GOSSYM model would be much more useful if the influence of nutrients other than carbon and nitrogen, UV-B radiation effects, fiber quality parameters as affected by environmental and cultural factors and severe weather factors such as hail and rain studied systematically are incorporated into the model.},

The software development process is documented to provide direction for future software application initiatives, with particular emphasis on a process of user feedback, evaluation and support requirements providing direction to software development. On-farm experiments throughout the development period allowed the validation of internal software logic, irrigator decision processes, and the OZCOT cotton growth model. The software demonstrated the ability to improve yield and water use efficiency by optimising strategic and tactical irrigation decisions in the Australian furrow irrigation cotton production system. In 7 of the 11 on-farm experiments conducted, the use of HydroLOGIC helped improve overall field water use efficiency by optimising the timing of irrigation events or by indicating further irrigations would not provide yield or maturity benefits. The paper also presents useful insights into the development of software targeted for irrigation utilising in-field measurements of soil water, crop growth and a crop growth simulation model.},

  abstract = {A model is presented for calculating the daily evaporation rate from a crop surface. It applies to a row crop canopy situation in which the soil water supply to the plant roots is not limited and the crop has not come into an advanced stage of maturation or senescence. The crop evaporation rate is calculated by adding the soil surface and plant surface components (each of these requiring daily numbers for the leaf area index), the potential evaporation, the rainfall, and the net radiation above the canopy. The evaporation from the soil surface Es is calculated in two stages: (1) the constant rate stage in which Es is limited only by the supply of energy to the surface and (2) the falling rate stage in which water movement to the evaporating sites near the surface is controlled by the hydraulic properties of the soil. The evaporation from the plant surfaces Ep is predicted by using an empirical relation based on local data, which shows how Ep is related to Eo through the leaf area index. The model was used to obtain the total evaporation rate E = Es + Ep of a developing grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) canopy in central Texas. The results agreed well with values for E measured directly with a weighing lysimeter.},

  abstract = {The objective of the CERES crop simulation models is to predict the duration of growth, the average growth rates, and the amount of assimilate partitioned to the economic yield components of the plant. With such a simulation system, optimizing the use of resources and quantifying risk related to weather variation is possible. The cereal crops included in the DSSAT v3 models are maize, wheat, barley, sorghum, millet and rice. A feature of each model is its capability to include cultivar specific information that make possible prediction of the cultivar variations in plant ontogeny and yield component characteristics and their interactions with weather. Biomass growth is calculated using the radiation use efficiency approach; biomass produced is partitioned between leaves, stems, roots, ears and grains. The proportion partitioned to each growing organ is determined by the stage of development and general growing conditions. The partitioning principles are based on a sink source concept and are modified when deficiencies of water and nutrient supplies occur. Crop yields in the CERES models are determined as a product of the grain numbers per plant times the average kernel weight at physiological maturity. The grain numbers are calculated from the above ground biomass growth during a critical stage in the plant growth cycle for a fixed thermal time before anthesis. The grain weight in all the CERES models is calculated as a function of cultivar specific optimum growth rate multiplied by the duration of grain filling. Grain filling is reduced below the optimum value when there is an insufficient supply of assimilate from either the daily biomass production or from stored mobile biomass in the stem. The CERES models have been tested over a wide range of environments. Although there are improvements that can be made in the simulation procedures, results have shown that when the weather, cultivar and management information is reasonably quantified, the yield results are usually within acceptable limits of {$\pm$} 5\% to 15\% of measured yields.}

  abstract = {Most crop, hydrology, and water quality models require the simulation of evaporation from the soil surface. A model developed by J.T. Ritchie in 1972 provides useful algorithms for estimating soil evaporation, but it does not calculate the soil water redistribution resulting from evaporation. A physically-based model using diffusion theory, described previously by Suleiman and Ritchie in 2003, provides efficient algorithms for soil water redistribution and soil evaporation. However, the model is appropriate only for second stage drying when the soil in the entire profile being simulated is below the drained upper limit (\texttheta DUL) and no more drainage occurs due to gravity. This paper extends the Suleiman\textendash Ritchie model for soil water contents higher than \texttheta DUL where soil evaporation rates are usually higher than second stage drying. New algorithms were developed for these wetter conditions that are functions of soil depth and the wetness of the near-surface soil. New model parameters were calibrated with data measured in laboratory soil column studies. The resulting model was integrated into DSSAT-CSM (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer Cropping Systems Model). Simulated soil evaporation rates and soil water contents obtained using the Suleiman\textendash Ritchie model with the developed extensions and the previous DSSAT soil evaporation model were compared and evaluated with field measurements of soil water content during several drying cycles for parts of 3 yr in North Central Florida. Computed soil water contents from the model agreed well with the measured soil water contents near the surface, and provided more accurate estimations than the original DSSAT soil evaporation model, especially for the 5-cm surface layer.},

The need to reduce nitrogen losses in this region can be addressed with the development and validation of robust, new assessment tools that can be used to quickly evaluate management practices and their effects on the environment in terms of potential nitrogen losses and other factors. The recently developed concept of trading nitrogen in air and water quality markets can be used in conjunction with field studies to assess the potential benefits of nitrogen management. In 2008 and 2009, field studies were conducted to collect data to test the new Nitrogen Loss and Environmental Assessment Package (NLEAP) and its ability to simulate nitrate dynamics for different cropping systems grown in three different locations in the Arkansas Delta. Simulation by the NLEAP conducted for cotton, soybean, and corn grown in the Arkansas Delta showed that the model was able to simulate the effects of management on residual soil nitrate (P {$<$} 0.01). The simulation showed that residual nitrate can range from about 10 to 240 kg NO3-N ha-1 in the top 1.5 m of soil, in agreement with measured values. In addition, long-term NLEAP simulation analysis showed that rotations of soybeans into corn systems significantly reduced emissions of N2O across this region and reduced NO3-N leaching losses at the field level.},

  abstract = {Cotton produced in Uzbekistan has a low water and fertilizer use efficiency and yield is below its potential. To introduce improved production methods, knowledge is required on how the agro-ecosystem would respond to these alternatives. For this assessment, dynamic simulation models such as the crop-soil simulation model CropSyst are useful tools. CropSyst had never been applied to cotton, so it first was calibrated to the cotton variety Khorezm-127 grown under researcher-managed optimal conditions in the Khorezm region of Uzbekistan in 2005. The model performance was evaluated with a data set obtained in 2004 on two farmer-managed sites. Both data sets comprised in-situ measurements of leaf area index and aboveground biomass. In addition, the 2004 data set included the normalized difference vegetation index derived from satellite imagery of the two cotton fields, which provided estimations of leaf area index with a high temporal resolution. The calibrated optimum mean daily temperature for cotton growth was 25 \textdegree C., the specific leaf area 13.0 m2 kg-1, the leaf/stem partition coefficient 3.0, the biomass/transpiration coefficient 8.1 kg m-2 kPa m-2 and the radiation use efficiency 2.0 g MJ-1. Simulations matched 2005 data, achieving a root mean square error between simulated and observed leaf area index and aboveground biomass of 0.36 m2 m-2 and 0.97 Mg ha-1, respectively. The evaluation showed that early cotton growth and leaf area index development could be simulated with sufficient accuracy using CropSyst. However, final aboveground biomass was slightly overestimated by CropSyst, because some unaccounted plant stress at the sites diminished actual aboveground biomass, leading to a root means square error of around 2 Mg ha-1. Some characteristics of cotton, such as the indeterminate growth habit, could not be incorporated in detail in the model. However, these simplifications were compensated by various other advantages of CropSyst, such as the option to simulate crop-rotation or its generic crop growth routine that allows modelling of additional, undocumented crops. The availability of normalized difference vegetation index data with a high temporal and acceptable spatial resolution opened possibilities for a precise, in-expensive and resource-efficient way of model evaluation.},

  abstract = {In modeling canopy photosynthesis, it is important to discriminate between the direct and diffuse components of incoming, global radiation. An equation is presented to estimate the share of both components from the measured daily global irradiance only. In this equation the share of the diffuse component is related to the ratio between global and extra-terrestrial radiation. This relation is based on a summary of literature data and of radiation measurements in The Netherlands. The diurnal trends of global, direct and diffuse radiation were derived from a sinusoid with a correction depending on solar angle. The random variation around this sine wave is characterized. For clear skies about 15\% of the diffuse flux comes predominantly from directions near the sun and this circumsolar component has to be added to the direct flux. On the other hand, for clear skies the diffuse fraction in the photosynthetically active wave bands is about 40\% larger than that for the total global radiation. In the past, the partitioning between direct and diffuse radiation was tackled by assuming that short periods of either fully clear or overcast conditions alternate within the day. That approach severely underestimated the share of the diffuse component in the total global radiation. The method presented in this paper is particularly useful for application in crop growth models.},

GOSSYM, a physiologically based cotton (L.) simulation model, was developed as an experimental tool but has been modified and adapted as a crop management tool. For GOSSYM to be used successfully in crop management, especially as an irrigation scheduling predictor, its ability to accurately calculate and partition total water use between transpiration () and soil water evaporation () must be evaluated. A field study with cotton was conducted at Lubbock, TX, in 1994 in an Olton soil (fine, mixed, thermic Aridic Paleustoll) to compare GOSSYM's calculations of , , and evapotranspiration (ET = +) with values measured neutron attenuation, microlysimetry, and stem flow gauges. During a 12-d period when and were measured separately, GOSSYM underestimated cumulative by 18\%, while cumulative was in close agreement with measured values. Underestimation of was due to overestimation of leaf area index (LAI), thus reducing simulated incident irradiance at the soil surface. A comparison of calculated and measured values of daily over 60 d showed that calculated daily 's were 40\% greater than measured values during the initial 10 d, 50\% less during the last 10 d, and in close agreement in between. Differences between calculated and measured daily -values were attributed to GOSSYM underestimating potential ET and overestimating LAI. However, ET over 102 d was calculated within 10\% at the end of the measuring period. These data suggest that GOSSYM can be used to assess water use in cotton, and as a tool for scheduling irrigations in a semiarid region, provided that current algorithms used to calculate potential ET are modified to include air humidity.},

  abstract = {This article introduces the FAO crop model AquaCrop. It simulates attainable yields of major herbaceous crops as a function of water consumption under rainfed, supplemental, deficit, and full irrigation conditions. The growth engine of AquaCrop is water-driven, in that transpiration is calculated first and translated into biomass using a conservative, crop-specific parameter: the biomass water productivity, normalized for atmospheric evaporative demand and air CO 2 concentration. The normalization is to make AquaCrop applicable to diverse locations and seasons. Simulations are performed on thermal time, but can be on calendar time, in daily time-steps. The model uses canopy ground cover instead of leaf area index (LAI) as the basis to calculate transpiration and to separate out soil evaporation from transpiration. Crop yield is calculated as the product of biomass and harvest index (HI). At the start of yield formation period, HI increases linearly with time after a lag phase, until near physiological maturity. Other than for the yield, there is no biomass partitioning into the various organs. Crop responses to water deficits are simulated with four modifiers that are functions of fractional available soil water modulated by evaporative demand, based on the differential sensitivity to water stress of four key plant processes: canopy expansion, stomatal control of transpiration, canopy senescence, and HI. The HI can be modified negatively or positively, depending on stress level, timing, and canopy duration. AquaCrop uses a relatively small number of parameters (explicit and mostly intuitive) and attempts to balance simplicity, accuracy, and robustness. The model is aimed mainly at practitioner-type end-users such as those working for extension services, consulting engineers, governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and various kinds of farmers associations. It is also designed to fit the need of economists and policy specialists who use simple models for planning and scenario analysis.},

Few studies, however, have assessed the applicability of AquaCrop for cotton under film-mulched drip irrigation in salt-affected soil. The objectives of this study were to test AquaCrop performance and to determine the appropriate irrigation amounts for cotton under several scenarios of initial soil-water content (SWC) and soil salinity for two typical soils in a saline region of southern Xinjiang of China with film-mulched drip irrigation. A four-year irrigation experiment was conducted in 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016 growing seasons for cotton, covering full (100\%), over (115 and 145\% of full) and deficit (55\textendash 90\% of full) irrigation treatments. Based on the recommended parameters for cotton in AquaCrop manual, the model was calibrated using 2016 data sets and validated using the data sets from the other three years. Simulations of canopy cover, soil water storage of the root zone and aboveground biomass fitted well with the field observations with coefficient of determination r2{$>$}0.77 and the index of agreement d{$>$}0.92 and slightly underestimated yield. As for soil salinity, the model gave a reliable simulation for less than 80\% of full irrigation treatments, while underestimated for over 80\% of full irrigation treatments. Overall, AquaCrop can be used as a feasible tool to predict cotton growth response to water under film-mulched drip irrigation in this region. According to the principle of high yield and WUE, the simulation results showed that the appropriate irrigation amounts were recommended at 358\textendash 457mm for silty loam and 406\textendash 462mm for sandy loam in this region, which can provide a reference for irrigation optimization under film-mulched drip irrigation in southern Xinjiang and other similar regions.},

  abstract = {The development and application of cropping system simulation models for cotton production has a long and rich history, beginning in the southeastern U. S. in the 1960s and now expanded to major cotton production regions globally. This paper briefly reviews the history of cotton simulation models, examines applications of the models since the turn of the century, and identifies opportunities for improving models and their use in cotton research and decision support. Cotton models reviewed include those specific to cotton (GOSSYM, Cotton2K, COTCO2, OZCOT, and CROPGRO-Cotton) and generic crop models that have been applied to cotton production (EPIC, WOFOST, SUCROS, GRAMI, CropSyst, and AquaCrop). Model application areas included crop water use and irrigation water management, nitrogen dynamics and fertilizer management, genetics and crop improvement, climatology, global climate change, precision agriculture, model integration with sensor data, economics, and classroom instruction. Generally, the literature demonstrated increased emphasis on cotton model development in the previous century and on cotton model application in the current century. Although efforts to develop cotton models have a 40-year history, no comparisons among cotton models were reported. Such efforts would be advisable as an initial step to evaluate current cotton simulation strategies. Increasingly, cotton simulation models are being applied by nontraditional crop modelers, who are not trained agronomists but wish to use the models for broad economic or life-cycle analyses. Although this trend demonstrates the growing interest in the models and their potential utility for a variety of applications, it necessitates the development of models with appropriate complexity and ease-of-use for a given application, and improved documentation and teaching materials are needed to educate potential model users. Spatial scaling issues are also increasingly prominent, as models originally developed for use at the field scale are being implemented for regional simulations over large geographic areas. Research steadily progresses toward the advanced goal of model integration with variable-rate control systems, which use real-time crop status and environmental information to spatially and temporally optimize applications of crop inputs, while also considering potential environmental impacts, resource limitations, and climate forecasts. Overall, the review demonstrates a languished effort in cotton simulation model development, but the application of existing models in a variety of research areas remains strong and continues to grow.},

  abstract = {The development of sensors that provide geospatial information on crop and soil conditions has been a primary success for precision agriculture. However, further developments are needed to integrate geospatial data into computer algorithms that spatially optimize crop production while considering potential environmental impacts and resource limitations. The objective of this research was to combine several information technologies, including remote sensing, a cropping system model, and a geographic information system (GIS), to synthesize and interpret geospatial data collected during two irrigation scheduling experiments conducted in 2009 and 2011 in a 5-ha cotton field in central Arizona. The Geospatial Simulation (GeoSim) plug-in for Quantum GIS was used to manage geospatial data and conduct site-specific simulations with the CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model. Simulated annealing optimization was used to adjust five model parameters to simulate site-specific conditions in 320 zones across the field. Using input parameters for GeoSim, a multiple criteria objective function was developed to incorporate measured and simulated leaf area index (LAI), crop canopy height, seed cotton yield, and evapotranspiration (ET) for site-specific optimization of CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton. Parameter identifiability and equifinality issues associated with model inversion were investigated. The optimized model was used for post hoc analysis of irrigation rates that maximized site-specific irrigation water use efficiency. With spatial optimization, the model was able to simulate LAI with root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 15 and 8~\% in the 2009 and 2011 experiments, respectively. The RMSEs between measured and simulated canopy height, seed cotton yield, and ET were 5~\% or less in both seasons. Some parameters were more identifiable than others during model inversions. Multiple temporal estimates of LAI were effective for constraining the model's specific leaf area parameter (SLAVR, cm2 g-1), but lack of information on root growth reduce identifiability of a parameter related to that process (SRGF0). Post-hoc simulation analysis of irrigation management options showed that irrigation schedules based on remotely sensed vegetation indices increased irrigation water use efficiency as compared to traditional scheduling methods, particularly in the 2009 growing season. In 2011, the analysis showed that all scheduling methods resulted in excess irrigation application, and higher deep seepage rates were simulated in that season. Taken together, the results demonstrate that well-designed software tools and algorithms for data processing and interpretation can be potentially transformative for integrating multiple geospatial data sets to compute optimum scenarios for precision irrigation management.},

In this study, we used two FAO's agronomic models named AquaCrop and CROPWAT, as well as two water footprint methodological frameworks to assess the impact of irrigation technology and strategy on the reduction of cotton water footprint in Northern Greece. Results showed that the impact of both irrigation technology and irrigation strategy in the green, blue and total water footprints was better estimated by AquaCrop model while CROPWAT model seems to be able to evaluate only the changes in the irrigation strategy. The drip technology could reduce the total water footprint by 5\%, when compared to sprinkler, while deficit irrigation by roughly 12\%, when compared to full.

  abstract = {The WOFOST simulation model is a tool for analysing the growth and production of field crops under a wide range of weather and soil conditions. Such an analysis is important first to assess to what extent crop production is limited by the factors of light, moisture and macro-nutrients, and second to estimate what improvements are possible. The theoretical concept of a production situation, as modelled by WOFOST, is explained, as is the hierarchy of potential production and water-limited and nutrient-limited production situations in the analysis. The organization of the computer files in the model, the structure of the FORTRAN source program and the available standard sets of data are described briefly.},

  abstract = {Since the pioneering work of C.T. de Wit in the 1960s, the Wageningen group has built a tradition in developing and applying crop models. Rather than focusing on a few models, diversity is its trademark. Here we present an overview of the Wageningen crop and crop-soil modelling approaches along three criteria. The first criterion relates to the production situations the models are dealing with (i.e. potential, water and/or nutrient-limited, and actual production situations including pests, diseases and weeds). Second, models differ as a result of the objectives of model development, and hence required scale and degree of detail and comprehensiveness. Third, models have at least three potential application domains, i.e. research, education and support of learning and decision making processes. We describe both summary and more comprehensive modelling approaches for the major production situations. An overview of most of the Wageningen models is presented together with a more detailed description of LINTUL, SUCROS, ORYZA, WOFOST and INTERCOM. Illustrations for each of the three application domains are presented, i.e. plant type design, guiding experimental research, education, yield gap analysis, evaluation of manure policies, crop growth monitoring system and analysis and design of farming and regional land use systems. We discuss common issues of model verification, model validation, model validity and data requirements, and present information on software implementation, model and software documentation and distribution policy. Finally, we reflect upon the Wageningen modelling approaches and identify a number of key issues for future research. Major achievements of Wageningen modelling efforts include (1) a broad variety of approaches for modelling of systems at different scales and with different purposes; (2) their contribution to quantitative systems thinking in general, also for applications at higher hierarchical levels; (3) a strong linkage between crop modelling and higher education, both at undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral level. To continually increase our understanding of crops and production systems a diversified approach must be cherished. At the same time we conclude that focus is required on a limited number of modules in a more integrated modelling framework for the benefit of analysing, evaluating and designing cropping systems. This review may be instrumental in the development of such an integrated framework.},

  abstract = {In conjunction with the Free-Air-CO2-Enrichment (FACE) project, a new, physiologically based, mechanistic, modular simulation model of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) physiology, growth, development, yield and water use has been constructed. It is named COTCO2 for cotton response to atmospheric CO2 concentration. The model is capable of predicting cotton crop responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations and potential concomitant changing climate variables. The major plant processes known to be influenced by CO2 are simulated explicitly, i.e. photosynthesis, photorespiration, and stomatal conductance, and its role in leaf energy balance. The model explicitly simulates the impact of atmospheric CO2 concentration on C3 photosynthesis and photorespiration at the level of carboxylation and oxygenation. Growth is simulated for individual organs, i.e. leaf blade, stem segment, taproot and lateral roots, and fruit which includes squares and bolls. Potential growth is calculated and the carbohydrate and nitrogen required to meet this potential are calculated. Actual growth is based on substrate availability, the potential growth, and water stress. Our intent here is to describe the overall structure of the model, its present status, and future development plans. Further development, documentation, calibration, and validation of the model is in progress. The long range goal of the project is to provide quantitative estimates of global cotton production in a future higher-CO2 world.}

  abstract = {Large-scale crop mapping is essential for agricultural management. Phenological variation often exists in the same crop due to different climatic regions or practice management, resulting in current classification models requiring sufficient training samples from different regions. However, the cost of sample collection is more time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive, so it is necessary to develop automatic crop mapping models that require only a few samples and can be extended to a large area. In this study, a new white bolls index (WBI) based on the unique canopy of cotton at the bolls opening stage was proposed, which can characterize the intensity of bolls opening. The value of WBI will increase as the opening of the bolls increases. As a result, the white bolls index can be used to detect cotton automatically from other crops. Four study areas in different regions were used to evaluate the WBI performance. The overall accuracy (OA) for the four study sites was more than 82\%. Additionally, the dates when the opening stage of bolls begins can be determined based on the time series of WBI. The results of this research demonstrated the potential of the proposed approach for cotton mapping using sentinel-2 time series of remotely sensed data.},

Also, simulation of many crops is required because of the wide variety grown in the U.S. EPIC simulates all crops with one crop growth model using unique parameter values for each crop. The processes simualted include leaf interception of solar radiation; conversion to biomass; division of biomass into roots, above ground mass, and economic yield; root growth; water use; and nutrient uptake. The model has been tested throughout the U.S. and in several foreign countries.}

  abstract = {COTTON2K, like most other cotton production models, does not always adequately represent local growth conditions owing to the fact that it fails to take into account some indigenous cultivation practices. For instance, pruning and topping, a common practice for cotton cultivation in China is not included in the model simulation of COTTON2K. The objective of this research therefore was to: (1) modify COTTON2K source code and slot pruning and topping simulation switch on to the model, and (2) calibrate and validate the modified COTTON2K model with field data from pruning and topping cultivation practice. First, field collected data in 2003 and 2004 were compared between the treatments, with and without pruning and topping, and the COTTON2K source code updated with the `pruning and topping' switch. This was followed by the calibration and validation of the updated model with field data and simulation of the effect of pruning and topping on cotton performance. It was noted from field observations that pruning and topping reduced total fruit sites, but at the same time, increased retained boll number, possibly due to significant reductions in abscised fruit sites. Though total dry matter production dropped, more dry matter allocation to reproductive organs, however, enhanced higher cotton lint yield in the pruning and topping treatment. Results of the modified model simulation showed that growth in the number of main-stem node ceased after topping. Furthermore, there was more biomass allocation to reproductive organs, such as green and open bolls under pruning and topping. Coefficient of determination above 0.8 for most of the growth factors was obtained in the calibration and validation processes under pruning and topping, a strong indication of the level of success of the model modification.},

  abstract = {Models for water transfer in the crop\textendash soil system are key components of agro-hydrological models for irrigation, fertilizer and pesticide practices. Many of the hydrological models for water transfer in the crop\textendash soil system are either too approximate due to oversimplified algorithms or employ complex numerical schemes. In this paper we developed a simple and sufficiently accurate algorithm which can be easily adopted in agro-hydrological models for the simulation of water dynamics. We used a dual crop coefficient approach proposed by the FAO for estimating potential evaporation and transpiration, and a dynamic model for calculating relative root length distribution on a daily basis. In a small time step of 0.001d, we implemented algorithms separately for actual evaporation, root water uptake and soil water content redistribution by decoupling these processes. The Richards equation describing soil water movement was solved using an integration strategy over the soil layers instead of complex numerical schemes. This drastically simplified the procedures of modeling soil water and led to much shorter computer codes. The validity of the proposed model was tested against data from field experiments on two contrasting soils cropped with wheat. Good agreement was achieved between measurement and simulation of soil water content in various depths collected at intervals during crop growth. This indicates that the model is satisfactory in simulating water transfer in the crop\textendash soil system, and therefore can reliably be adopted in agro-hydrological models. Finally we demonstrated how the developed model could be used to study the effect of changes in the environment such as lowering the groundwater table caused by the construction of a motorway on crop transpiration.},

Surface water that is currently restricted to urban use could then become partly available for agricultural production. This will reduce the dependence of agriculture on groundwater, which will in turn retard groundwater depletion in the region. This study determines the spatial and temporal distributions of agricultural water requirement in Hebei Plain. This in turn lays the basis for surface water reallocation following the completion of the SNWT project. DSSAT and COTTON2K crop models are used along with crop coefficient methods to estimate required irrigation amounts for wheat, maize, cotton, vegetables and fruit trees in Hebei Plain. The study uses 20 years (1986\textendash 2006) of agronomic, hydrologic and climate data collected from 43 well-distributed stations across the plain. Based on the results, wheat accounts for over 40\% of total irrigation water requirement in the plain. Similarly, wheat, maize and cotton together account for 64\% of the total irrigation water requirement. The piedmont regions of Mount Taihang have the highest irrigation requirement due to high percent farm and irrigated land area. The months of April and May have the highest irrigation water requirement, respectively accounting for 18.1\% and 25.4\% of average annual irrigation. Spatial and temporal variations in our estimated irrigation water requirement are higher than those in the officially published statistics data. The higher variations in our results are more reflective of field conditions (e.g. precipitation, cropping pattern, irrigated land area, etc.). This therefore indicates a substantive improvement (in our study) over the average statistical data. Based on our simulation results, viable surface water reallocation strategies following the completion of the SNWT project are advanced and discussed.},

The FAO's AquaCrop model version 4.0 was calibrated and validated for crop canopy cover, dry aboveground biomass, soil water content and grain yield. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) for grain yield and dry aboveground biomass was 0.293 and 2.2~t~ha-1, respectively. The RMSE for the rootzone soil water content was 25~mm. The validated model was used to analyse the effect of in-season and off-season conditions on grain yield and water productivity. Grain yield and water productivity decreased (50\% for Gregory and 43\% for Livingston) with the delay in sowing date. Applying four irrigations to the mid-May sown wheat resulted in a higher (6.5, 5.7 and 5.2~t~ha-1, respectively, at 80\% exceedance probability) yield relative to the mid-April and mid-June sowing dates. Applying supplemental irrigation both in September and October resulted in a better yield (6.7 vs. 6.0~t~ha-1) and water productivity than applying irrigation only in October. The effect of off-season managements such as mulch and pre-irrigation on yield is 68\% higher in low-rainfall years that that of in the wet years.},

  abstract = {棉花生长模拟模型是建立棉花生产管理决策系统的重要基础，也是评价棉花生产潜力、预测气候变化的影响及智能化栽培和辅助育种的有力工具。本研究借鉴国内外先进的作物模拟理论和方法体系，在充分吸收了和利用已有研究成果的基础上，结合田间试验研究，对棉花生长发育基本规律及其与环境因子的互作进行了系统分析和综合，从而构建了一个基于生理生态过程的具有广泛适用性的棉花生长发育模拟模型，为实现棉花生长调控的信息化和数字化奠定了基础。 模型基于棉花生长发育的生理生态过程，以生理发育时间作为定量棉花发育进程的通用尺度，选用有效的函数类型和品种早熟性参数，充分考虑了温度、光周期和品种遗传特性等因子对棉花发育进程的影响和因子间的互作。模型以生理发育时间作为棉花的生理年龄，较发育阶段和发育指数尺度的连续性好，并且生理意义更加明确。模型对全国区试3年不同站点和不同生态区的区试资料和试验数据进行了系统分析，构建了不同类型品种的遗传性参数，保证了不同类型品种到达特定发育阶段所需的生理发育时间恒定。采用土壤温度模拟棉花出苗过程，充分考虑了地膜覆盖的土壤增温效应，并通过温度补偿效应系数CE，量化了地温对气温的补偿作用，保证了地膜覆盖条件下生理发育时间的恒定，使模型适合于地膜覆盖栽培。 引用简便有效的高斯积分法计算冠层每日的总光合同化量，不但考虑了光合有效辐射的日变化规律，而且考虑了太阳高度角的变化对冠层直射光消光系数的影响。模型在考虑了直射PAR对光合作用贡献的同时，还考虑了天空散射辐射、冠层内叶片对PAR的透射和反射作用以及土壤表面对PAR的反射作用。 形态发生模拟利用生理热效应RTE为模型的驱动因子，较充分地量化了适温范围以外的不利效应，同时RTE还涵盖了地膜覆盖对形态发生的作用。叶片数、株高、果枝和果节的模拟精度RMSE分别达到了0.7片、1.6cm、0.8个和3.3个。 叶面积指数模拟应用了同化物的源、库、流关系，分别模拟了棉花生育过程中源或库不足时的叶面积指数增长过程，并进行了有效综合。模型经过不同基因型和管理措施下的校正，在不同品种和管理方式下模拟精度达到了0.3，具有较好的适应性。 结合田间根钻取样和图像扫描分析方法，研究了棉花根系长度、直径和表面积生长动态及其在0-100cm深0-40cm宽土壤范围内的空间分布。与常规直尺测量结果相比，根系图像扫描分析法具有较强的先进性和可靠性(R=0.948，n=1318)。研究表明，棉花平均根长密度(RLD)，在花铃期为1.21-1.27mm．cm\textasciitilde (-3)，吐絮后降至1.04-1.12mm．cm\textasciitilde (-3)，收花时为0.76mm．cm\textasciitilde (-3)。棉花根系平均直径在不同基因型间存在显著差异(P=0.022)， 以杭虫杂交棉的根系直径最粗，平均为0.52\textasciitilde;早熟类型品种根系直径较细，平均 只为o.36mm，且在土壤深度上的差异不显著少=0.869)，但距棉行距离越远，根系的平 均直径越小甲=0.000)。在研究根系长度和直径动态规律的基础上，提出了根表面积指 数(RAI)的概念，与地上部叶面积指数具有相似的含义和生物学意义，且呈较好约 指数相关关系(Rz=0.779)。RAI在PDT小于等于40前，其增长动态符合LOGisTIC 生长规律(RZ=0.849);pDT大于40后，呈线性递减趋势(RZ为0.57一0.895)，且杂交 杭虫棉的RAI在全生育期内都明显高于其它类型品种，而早熟类型品种相对略低。RAI 空间分布特征为，开花前在浅根层内(0一30cm)分布最多，花铃期以中层根系('0一60cm) 为主，吐絮后主要以深层口O一loocm)和距棉行较远的行间较多。进一步提出了以RAI 代替RLD为根系因子分层模拟根系吸水量的模型，修正了含根系吸水函数的水量平 衡模型。 棉株在产量器官形成和发育过程中蕾铃脱落占总数的60一70\%，棉花蕾铃发育期占 全生育期的70\%左右，营养生长和生殖生长存在长期同生，所以给棉花蕾铃脱落的模 拟带来一定的难度。本研究采用车箱理论的方法，模拟不同基因型和管理措施下棉花 蕾铃发育和脱落的生理过程，并充分考虑了同化物供需比、水分和氮素亏缺的影响。 结果表明，利用这种系统模拟方法可以较准确定量棉花蕾铃发育和脱落过程，需要的 参数少，相对简单准确。 在系统分析不同基因型品种和不同管理措施下棉花干物质分配指数随生理发育 时间变化动态规律的基础上，吸收GOSSYM模型中潜在发育和同化物缓冲库的假设 理论，构建了棉花各器官干物质分配模型。首次将分配指数方法和潜在发育、缓冲库 理论结合在一起模拟棉花干物质分配和产量形成。 利用不同类型品种、年份、生态区、管理措施和播种期试验资料对模型进行了较 充分的校正与核实。结果表明，模型可以较好地预测不同环境、管理措施和基因型棉 花的生育期，模拟值与观测值的RMSE达到4.22d;可以较好地模拟叶片、株高、果 枝等器官发生以及叶面积指数、蕾铃脱落、单铃重、干物质分配、籽棉产量和皮棉产 量等，如不同品种和管理方式下LAI、脱落率、皮棉产量的模拟精度RMSE分别为。.3、 8{$\cdot$}15\%和40{$\cdot$}49 kg.hm一2。 本模型具有较强的系统性、机理性、解释性与预测性，使用参数少，易确定，简 便实用，但模型对叶片衰老过程及其死亡?},

  abstract = {Simulation of the formation of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fiber length and strength is still an area of great uncertainty. The aim of this study was to develop a model for simulating cotton fiber length and strength formation and explaining the effect of genotype, weather (temperature and solar radiation), and crop N supply on the two indices. The duration of fiber elongation for fiber length formation and secondary wall synthesis for fiber strength formation were determined as proportional to the boll physiological developmental time (PDT), which was simulated as a function of temperature, radiation, and N. The effect of temperature and radiation on fiber length and strength was modeled as a function of the photo-thermal product (PTP), the product of thermal effectiveness and radiation. The subtending leaf N concentration per unit area of cotton boll (NA) was used as the indicator of boll N nutrition. The changes of NA with boll development, N application rate, and boll position were simulated by a semi-empirical formula. Based on the relations between the actual and critical NA, the nitrogen response functions for the formation of fiber length and strength parameters were quantified, accounting for the interactive effects of N nutrition and PTP. Calibration and validation of the model were made using fiber quality data obtained from three years with two sowing dates and three or four N application rates at three locations in China. The average RMSE and RE for cotton fiber length and strength predictions were 1.03mm and 12.4\%, 2.20cNtex-1 and 10.4\%, respectively. The proposed model well explained the observed genotypic and environmental variations in fiber length and strength formation of cotton in China.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) and irrigation can be two of the costliest management inputs in United States (U.S.) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production systems. Furthermore, input amounts are often dependent on yearly environmental conditions, making it challenging to optimize N and irrigation management. The objectives of this research were to determine optimal N and irrigation management by: (i) evaluating equally split in-season N rates applied at first square and bloom in combination with varying levels of plant available water replacement (PAWR) estimated by an ET-based soil water balance model for cotton; and (ii) evaluate the whole-plant responses to the interaction between N and water management levels. Field experiments were conducted during 2015 and 2016 at two locations in Florida (Jay and Citra), southeastern U.S. with differing soil textures consisting of a deep sand and sandy loam. Irrigation treatments consisted of: (i) 100\% of PAWR (100\%); (ii) a primed acclimation (PA) treatment consisting of 50\% of PAWR until first bloom and then 100\% of PAWR (50\%PA); (iii) 50\% PAWR for the entire season (50\%); (iv) a rain-fed control (RF). Nitrogen treatments consisted of even application splits at first square and bloom applied at a rate of 0 (N0), 22 (N22), 34 (N34), and 45\,kg N ha-1 (N45). Lint yield assessments were conducted at both locations in both years. To link yield responses to possible physiological responses, in depth crop measurements consisting of SPAD chlorophyll content, leaf area index (LAI), N uptake, and harvest index (HI) were conducted at the Citra site. Contrasting soil textures and weather conditions between research locations and years allowed for a comprehensive assessment of both N and irrigation management across varying environmental conditions. Lint yield was either increased or at least maintained during the two years of this research at the Citra location by making two split N applications at first square and bloom of N22; while the optimal N treatment at the Jay location was N34 at first square and bloom in both years of this research. Additionally, a yield reduction occurred in the dry year of 2016 at the Citra location when N45 was applied at first square and bloom. The most efficient irrigation strategy at the Citra location was the primed acclimation treatment. At the Jay location, the RF control had similar lint yields as the irrigated treatments in both years, indicating that water application was not limiting at this site. These management strategies offer ways to optimize costly inputs when growing cotton in the southeastern U.S.},
