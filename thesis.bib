Cotton simulation models have been applied during last and current decades for the analysis of the cotton plant responses to drought, heat, and nutrients stress as well as to test the alternating optimum sowing window under climate warming trend in cotton belt. Cotton growth models are useful research tools in worldwide. Mostly cotton models were applied for climatic changes, cotton management practices, and irrigation strategies on lint and cottonseed yield in worldwide. All cotton models were successfully used at local, regional, and national levels in worldwide, but among all cotton growth models, CROPGRO-Cotton model was mostly used by researchers and policy makers. For irrigation management strategies, mostly AquaCrop model was used by researchers.},

  abstract = {Agricultural systems models worldwide are increasingly being used to explore options and solutions for the food security, climate change adaptation and mitigation and carbon trading problem domains. APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) is one such model that continues to be applied and adapted to this challenging research agenda. From its inception twenty years ago, APSIM has evolved into a framework containing many of the key models required to explore changes in agricultural landscapes with capability ranging from simulation of gene expression through to multi-field farms and beyond. Keating et~al. (2003) described many of the fundamental attributes of APSIM in detail. Much has changed in the last decade, and the APSIM community has been exploring novel scientific domains and utilising software developments in social media, web and mobile applications to provide simulation tools adapted to new demands. This paper updates the earlier work by Keating et~al. (2003) and chronicles the changing external challenges and opportunities being placed on APSIM during the last decade. It also explores and discusses how APSIM has been evolving to a ``next generation'' framework with improved features and capabilities that allow its use in many diverse topics.},

  abstract = {作物生长模拟模型和管理决策支持系统是信息农业和数字农业研究与应用的核心与典范。作物生长模拟模型具有系统综合和动态预测的功能，但至今尚缺乏对作物品质形成过程的定量模拟，基于模拟模型的作物管理决策支持系统能够通过模拟试验，实现系统管理的策略分析和方案评估。本研究以棉花为研究对象，在本实验室已有棉花生长发育和产量品质形成模拟模型的基础上，运用系统分析原理和数学建模技术，综合了棉花器官建成与蕾铃脱落、棉铃干物质积累分配、纤维品质的形成与环境因子的动态关系，建立了基于棉花生理发育时间(PDT)的生育期模拟模型、基于生理生态过程的棉花器官建成和蕾铃脱落模拟模型、单铃干物质积累分配模拟模型、纤维品质时空分布模拟模型。应用面向对象的程序设计与软构件技术，在Visual C++平台上构建了综合性与构件化的棉花生长发育和产量品质形成的模拟系统；进一步运用决策支持技术，结合基于不同目标的模拟试验与策略分析，研制了具有辅助决策功能的基于生长模型的棉花管理决策支持系统。研究结果为当今数字化农作系统的开发提供了基本框架，也为建立其它作物管理决策支持系统提供了开发模式。具体研究结果如下： 	(1)系统分析了不同肥料、不同密度试验棉花生育与环境因素之间的动态关系，综合考虑了热效应(RTE)、光周期效应(RPE)、品种早熟性(VE)，建立了以PDT为驱动变量的棉花生育期模拟模型；在充分考虑氮素营养、土壤水分胁迫、DPC调控等对棉花生育的影响基础上，构建了棉花器官建成和蕾铃脱落模拟模型。利用不同年份、品种和播期的试验资料对上述模型进行了检验。结果表明，棉花生育期模拟值与观测值间的均方差根(RMSE)为0.80～1.65，吻合度较好，精度较高；叶片数、株高、果枝数、果节数、脱落数、成铃数的模拟值与观察值间的RMSE值分别为0.36叶、1.11cm、0.57台、2.87个、1.00个、0.59个，模拟误差小于3％，具有较高的模拟精度，适应性较好。 	(2)在系统分析不同基因型、施肥量、开花期棉铃干物质积累与分配动态规律的基础上，以RTE为驱动变量，在综合考虑了氮素营养、水分胁迫、同化物供需比等对棉铃的生长发育主要影响因子的前提下，建立了基于RTE的棉花单铃干物质积累分配的分期动态模型；模拟检验结果显示，棉花四桃(伏前桃、伏桃、早秋桃、晚秋桃)单铃、籽棉、纤维干物质积累的RMSE值分别为0.1767～0.5659、0.0725～0.5279、0.0613～0.2634g，而单一综合模拟模型的RMSE值超过或接近分期模拟模型相对应的RMSE值的上限。因此，分期模拟棉铃干物质的积累与分配比单一综合模拟模型预测效果要准确、可靠。 	(3)在系统分析棉花花铃期的温度、光照、水分胁迫、氮素营养等主要因子对棉花纤维品质影响的基础上，量化了棉花品种、棉株空间不同枝节和花铃期的日均温、光照长度、土壤含水量、棉株含氮率对棉花纤维品质指标形成的影响，并结合已有的棉花纤维品质指标的生态模型，构建了机理性较强的预测纤维长度、比强度、麦克隆值、长度整齐度的单一纤维品质指标的时空分布模型和综合模型，利用不同年份、品种类型、生态区域、肥水管理条件下的试验资料对棉花纤维品质指标的时空分布模型进行了检验。检验结果表明，纤维长度、比强度、麦克隆值、长度整齐度的RMSE值，在时间分布模型中分别为0.15mm、0.29cN{$\cdot$}tex\textasciitilde (-1)、0.18和0.36，在空间分布模型中分别为0.22mm、0.60cN{$\cdot$}tex\textasciitilde (-1)和0.15和0.86，与实际观察值间的误差皆小于5％，说明模型具有较好的预测性、通用性和准确性。 	(4)以棉花生长发育为主线，采用面向对象的程序设计和软构件技术，结合气象数据生成模型和品种参数调试模型，构建了机理性和解释性较强的棉花生长模拟模型(CottonGrow)及棉花生长模拟系统(CGSS)。该系统主要包括生育进程、器官建成及形态发生、光合生产、物质分配、水分和养分平衡、产量与品质形成等模块，可以定量预测不同生态环境、生产条件和品种类型下的棉花生长发育过程和生产力形成动态。 	(5)在构建棉花生长模拟系统的基础上，结合基于不同目标的模拟试验及基于模型结果的策略分析评价模型，并充分利用软构件的语言无关性、可重性、简便快捷的系统维护机制等特点，在VC++与VB平台上构建了机理性、通用性、应用性等较强的棉花管理决策支持系统(GMDSSCM)，实现了模型的预测功能、决策支持功能和人机交互技术的有机耦合，可以为不同生态环境、生产条件和品种类型推荐适宜的棉花生产管理方案。GMDSSCM成功的研制，为今后数字棉作系统的研制奠定了基础。},

  abstract = {In low-input systems, where most nutrients become available from soil organic matter (SOM) and residue turnover, the applicability of DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) crop simulation models is limited because (i) it recognizes only one type of SOM (i.e., humus) and recently added, but not yet humified, residue; (ii) it does not recognize a residue layer on top of the soil; (iii) newly formed humus is given a fixed C/N ratio of 10; (iv) only one litter pool is recognized for N although three are recognized for C; (v) for residues with C/N ratios {$<$}25, the three litter pools for C decompose at a rate that is independent of the residue's N concentration; and (vi) SOM and residue flows are independent of soil texture. A SOM\textendash residue module from the CENTURY model was incorporated in the DSSAT crop simulation models, and a residue layer was added on top of the soil. Modifications were also made in the senescence module of CROPGRO, a model within DSSAT, so that senesced material is now added daily to the soil. Evaluation of the model, using a data set of 40 yr of bare fallow, showed an excellent fit [product moment correlation coefficient (r) of 0.983] between simulated and measured values for SOM-C. Soil N from decomposing SOM and residues was evaluated with data from a Brazilian experiment with seven leguminous residue types. By incorporating the CENTURY SOM\textendash residue module, DSSAT crop simulation models have become more suitable for simulating low-input systems and conducting long-term sustainability analyses.},

The function describing the processes in the fruiting model were made sensitive to solar radiation, water and nitrogen stress and water logging. A leaf area generator, a boll growth model and an elementary nitrogen model were added. The model was validated against six data sets from agronomic experiments over a period of 30 years covering the range of Australian cotton growing regions from 15\textdegree{} to 34\textdegree S. The model responded to climatic and agronomic (irrigation regime, nitrogen fertiliser rate and sowing date) variables at all sites, and without bias at 5 out of 6; a difference in soil type probably caused the bias at one site. Decision support needs dictated development of the model, which is no more complex than needed to supply information for management decisions. The project demonstrates that such a `top down' approach can produce a simple yet powerful simulator.},

  abstract = {The decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) has been in use for the last 15 years by researchers worldwide. This package incorporates models of 16 different crops with software that facilitates the evaluation and application of the crop models for different purposes. Over the last few years, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain the DSSAT crop models, partly due to fact that there were different sets of computer code for different crops with little attention to software design at the level of crop models themselves. Thus, the DSSAT crop models have been re-designed and programmed to facilitate more efficient incorporation of new scientific advances, applications, documentation and maintenance. The basis for the new DSSAT cropping system model (CSM) design is a modular structure in which components separate along scientific discipline lines and are structured to allow easy replacement or addition of modules. It has one Soil module, a Crop Template module which can simulate different crops by defining species input files, an interface to add individual crop models if they have the same design and interface, a Weather module, and a module for dealing with competition for light and water among the soil, plants, and atmosphere. It is also designed for incorporation into various application packages, ranging from those that help researchers adapt and test the CSM to those that operate the DSSAT\textendash CSM to simulate production over time and space for different purposes. In this paper, we describe this new DSSAT\textendash CSM design as well as approaches used to model the primary scientific components (soil, crop, weather, and management). In addition, the paper describes data requirements and methods used for model evaluation. We provide an overview of the hundreds of published studies in which the DSSAT crop models have been used for various applications. The benefits of the new, re-designed DSSAT\textendash CSM will provide considerable opportunities to its developers and others in the scientific community for greater cooperation in interdisciplinary research and in the application of knowledge to solve problems at field, farm, and higher levels.},

  abstract = {The simulation of cottonseed (Gossypium hirsutum L.) growth is still an area of great uncertainty, especially in the process of cottonseed quality formation. A simple process-based model was developed to predict cotton boll maturation period and simulate cottonseed biomass accumulation, protein, and oil content. The cotton boll maturation period module took solar radiation and N nutrition factors into account in addition to temperature and variety maturity profile. Based on the hypothesis that the accumulation of biomass, oil, and protein are mainly sink-determined, the model was developed by considering parameters of cultivar characteristics, weather (temperature and solar radiation), and crop management variables (precisely N supply). The subtending leaf N concentration of cotton boll was simulated by a new semi-empirical model, and worked as the direct indicator of the N nutrition effect on cottonseed growth and development. The model was calibrated using data obtained in experiment conducted in Nanjing (the lower reaches of Yangtze River Valley) in 2005 and 2006. The model was then tested using two field experimental data sets. One was obtained in Nanjing, China in 2007, and the other in the Yellow River Valley (Xuzhou and Anyang) and the lower reaches of Yangtze River Valley (Huaian), China in 2005. The simulated values of boll maturation period by the model were very consistent with the observed values, with root mean square error (RMSE) lower than 3 days. The RMSE of cottonseed dry weight, protein content, and oil content predictions were 8.9mgseed-1, 2.19\%, and 2.71\%, respectively. The result showed that the model is sufficiently robust to predict the cotton boll maturation period, cottonseed dry weight, and quality in wide range of conditions. It is not only a necessary component of cotton growth model, but also provides a good platform for further study in modeling cottonseed protein and oil yield.},

VARIwise accommodates sub-field-scale variations in all input parameters using a 1m2 cell size, and permits application of differing control strategies within the field, as well as differing irrigation amounts down to this scale. In this paper the motivation and objectives for the creation of VARIwise are discussed, the structure of the software is outlined and an example of the use and utility of VARIwise is presented. Three irrigation control strategies have been simulated in VARIwise using a cotton model with a range of input parameters including spatially variable soil properties, non-uniform irrigation application, three weather profiles and two crop varieties. The simulated yield and water use efficiency were affected by the combination of input parameters and the control strategy implemented.},

In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN/sup 2/) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.},

Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm following NSGA-II framework (we call it NSGA-III) that emphasizes population members that are nondominated, yet close to a set of supplied reference points. The proposed NSGA-III is applied to a number of many-objective test problems with three to 15 objectives and compared with two versions of a recently suggested EMO algorithm (MOEA/D). While each of the two MOEA/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed NSGA-III is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this paper.

Photomicrographs of leaf cross-sections and of the leaf surfaces were scanned and analyzed with the image analysis software. The data were used to parameterize the new WALL model, developed in this study to analyze the leaf transpiration with a special emphasis to liquid water movement inside the leaf. The transpiration stream was assumed to go from vein endings in two directions, towards the upper and lower leaf surfaces. These fluxes were presented as two parallel currents driven by the water vapour concentration difference between the atmosphere and the open surface of the vein endings and on the mesophyll and epidermis (inner parts) cells' surfaces as a flow in thin films of water. Simulations were run to estimate quantitatively the contribution of the cuticular transpiration to the total amount of leaf transpiration stream, to evaluate the role of the mesophyll cell walls' surfaces in the water transfer inside the leaf, and to calculate the dependence of transpiration and its components on temperature. Simulation results showed (1) a major role of the cuticular transpiration as a leaf cooling mechanism and (2) that the cell wall properties can affect water film characteristics that also affect the transpiration course.

A general framework is suggested. Data from a number of saturated land sites and open water sites in the absence of advection suggest a widely applicable formula for the relationship between sensible and latent heat fluxes. For drying land surfaces, we assume that the evaporation rate is given by the same formula for evaporation multiplied by a factor. This factor is found to remain at unity while an amount of water, varying from one site to another, is evaporated. Following this a linear decrease sets in, reducing the evaporation rate to zero after a further 5 cm of evaporation, the same at several sites examined.},

Within the Australian cotton industry, the imperative to reduce water use and optimise irrigation management through the understanding of risk, using information generated by computerised decision aids was identified and subsequently developed into the HydroLOGIC irrigation management software. This paper summarises the attributes of the HydroLOGIC irrigation management software, with particular emphasis on functionality and its application to irrigation decisions within the Australian cotton industry. The software development process is documented to provide direction for future software application initiatives, with particular emphasis on a process of user feedback, evaluation and support requirements providing direction to software development. On-farm experiments throughout the development period allowed the validation of internal software logic, irrigator decision processes, and the OZCOT cotton growth model. The software demonstrated the ability to improve yield and water use efficiency by optimising strategic and tactical irrigation decisions in the Australian furrow irrigation cotton production system. In 7 of the 11 on-farm experiments conducted, the use of HydroLOGIC helped improve overall field water use efficiency by optimising the timing of irrigation events or by indicating further irrigations would not provide yield or maturity benefits. The paper also presents useful insights into the development of software targeted for irrigation utilising in-field measurements of soil water, crop growth and a crop growth simulation model.},

It applies to a row crop canopy situation in which the soil water supply to the plant roots is not limited and the crop has not come into an advanced stage of maturation or senescence. The crop evaporation rate is calculated by adding the soil surface and plant surface components (each of these requiring daily numbers for the leaf area index), the potential evaporation, the rainfall, and the net radiation above the canopy. The evaporation from the soil surface Es is calculated in two stages: (1) the constant rate stage in which Es is limited only by the supply of energy to the surface and (2) the falling rate stage in which water movement to the evaporating sites near the surface is controlled by the hydraulic properties of the soil. The evaporation from the plant surfaces Ep is predicted by using an empirical relation based on local data, which shows how Ep is related to Eo through the leaf area index. The model was used to obtain the total evaporation rate E = Es + Ep of a developing grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) canopy in central Texas. The results agreed well with values for E measured directly with a weighing lysimeter.},

With such a simulation system, optimizing the use of resources and quantifying risk related to weather variation is possible. The cereal crops included in the DSSAT v3 models are maize, wheat, barley, sorghum, millet and rice. A feature of each model is its capability to include cultivar specific information that make possible prediction of the cultivar variations in plant ontogeny and yield component characteristics and their interactions with weather. Biomass growth is calculated using the radiation use efficiency approach; biomass produced is partitioned between leaves, stems, roots, ears and grains. The proportion partitioned to each growing organ is determined by the stage of development and general growing conditions. The partitioning principles are based on a sink source concept and are modified when deficiencies of water and nutrient supplies occur. Crop yields in the CERES models are determined as a product of the grain numbers per plant times the average kernel weight at physiological maturity. The grain numbers are calculated from the above ground biomass growth during a critical stage in the plant growth cycle for a fixed thermal time before anthesis. The grain weight in all the CERES models is calculated as a function of cultivar specific optimum growth rate multiplied by the duration of grain filling. Grain filling is reduced below the optimum value when there is an insufficient supply of assimilate from either the daily biomass production or from stored mobile biomass in the stem. The CERES models have been tested over a wide range of environments. Although there are improvements that can be made in the simulation procedures, results have shown that when the weather, cultivar and management information is reasonably quantified, the yield results are usually within acceptable limits of {$\pm$} 5\% to 15\% of measured yields.}

  abstract = {Most crop, hydrology, and water quality models require the simulation of evaporation from the soil surface. A model developed by J.T. Ritchie in 1972 provides useful algorithms for estimating soil evaporation, but it does not calculate the soil water redistribution resulting from evaporation. A physically-based model using diffusion theory, described previously by Suleiman and Ritchie in 2003, provides efficient algorithms for soil water redistribution and soil evaporation. However, the model is appropriate only for second stage drying when the soil in the entire profile being simulated is below the drained upper limit (\texttheta DUL) and no more drainage occurs due to gravity. This paper extends the Suleiman\textendash Ritchie model for soil water contents higher than \texttheta DUL where soil evaporation rates are usually higher than second stage drying. New algorithms were developed for these wetter conditions that are functions of soil depth and the wetness of the near-surface soil. New model parameters were calibrated with data measured in laboratory soil column studies. The resulting model was integrated into DSSAT-CSM (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer Cropping Systems Model). Simulated soil evaporation rates and soil water contents obtained using the Suleiman\textendash Ritchie model with the developed extensions and the previous DSSAT soil evaporation model were compared and evaluated with field measurements of soil water content during several drying cycles for parts of 3 yr in North Central Florida. Computed soil water contents from the model agreed well with the measured soil water contents near the surface, and provided more accurate estimations than the original DSSAT soil evaporation model, especially for the 5-cm surface layer.},

  abstract = {Cotton produced in Uzbekistan has a low water and fertilizer use efficiency and yield is below its potential. To introduce improved production methods, knowledge is required on how the agro-ecosystem would respond to these alternatives. For this assessment, dynamic simulation models such as the crop-soil simulation model CropSyst are useful tools. CropSyst had never been applied to cotton, so it first was calibrated to the cotton variety Khorezm-127 grown under researcher-managed optimal conditions in the Khorezm region of Uzbekistan in 2005. The model performance was evaluated with a data set obtained in 2004 on two farmer-managed sites. Both data sets comprised in-situ measurements of leaf area index and aboveground biomass. In addition, the 2004 data set included the normalized difference vegetation index derived from satellite imagery of the two cotton fields, which provided estimations of leaf area index with a high temporal resolution. The calibrated optimum mean daily temperature for cotton growth was 25 \textdegree C., the specific leaf area 13.0 m2 kg-1, the leaf/stem partition coefficient 3.0, the biomass/transpiration coefficient 8.1 kg m-2 kPa m-2 and the radiation use efficiency 2.0 g MJ-1. Simulations matched 2005 data, achieving a root mean square error between simulated and observed leaf area index and aboveground biomass of 0.36 m2 m-2 and 0.97 Mg ha-1, respectively. The evaluation showed that early cotton growth and leaf area index development could be simulated with sufficient accuracy using CropSyst. However, final aboveground biomass was slightly overestimated by CropSyst, because some unaccounted plant stress at the sites diminished actual aboveground biomass, leading to a root means square error of around 2 Mg ha-1. Some characteristics of cotton, such as the indeterminate growth habit, could not be incorporated in detail in the model. However, these simplifications were compensated by various other advantages of CropSyst, such as the option to simulate crop-rotation or its generic crop growth routine that allows modelling of additional, undocumented crops. The availability of normalized difference vegetation index data with a high temporal and acceptable spatial resolution opened possibilities for a precise, in-expensive and resource-efficient way of model evaluation.},

  abstract = {In modeling canopy photosynthesis, it is important to discriminate between the direct and diffuse components of incoming, global radiation. An equation is presented to estimate the share of both components from the measured daily global irradiance only. In this equation the share of the diffuse component is related to the ratio between global and extra-terrestrial radiation. This relation is based on a summary of literature data and of radiation measurements in The Netherlands. The diurnal trends of global, direct and diffuse radiation were derived from a sinusoid with a correction depending on solar angle. The random variation around this sine wave is characterized. For clear skies about 15\% of the diffuse flux comes predominantly from directions near the sun and this circumsolar component has to be added to the direct flux. On the other hand, for clear skies the diffuse fraction in the photosynthetically active wave bands is about 40\% larger than that for the total global radiation. In the past, the partitioning between direct and diffuse radiation was tackled by assuming that short periods of either fully clear or overcast conditions alternate within the day. That approach severely underestimated the share of the diffuse component in the total global radiation. The method presented in this paper is particularly useful for application in crop growth models.},

  abstract = {This article introduces the FAO crop model AquaCrop. It simulates attainable yields of major herbaceous crops as a function of water consumption under rainfed, supplemental, deficit, and full irrigation conditions. The growth engine of AquaCrop is water-driven, in that transpiration is calculated first and translated into biomass using a conservative, crop-specific parameter: the biomass water productivity, normalized for atmospheric evaporative demand and air CO 2 concentration. The normalization is to make AquaCrop applicable to diverse locations and seasons. Simulations are performed on thermal time, but can be on calendar time, in daily time-steps. The model uses canopy ground cover instead of leaf area index (LAI) as the basis to calculate transpiration and to separate out soil evaporation from transpiration. Crop yield is calculated as the product of biomass and harvest index (HI). At the start of yield formation period, HI increases linearly with time after a lag phase, until near physiological maturity. Other than for the yield, there is no biomass partitioning into the various organs. Crop responses to water deficits are simulated with four modifiers that are functions of fractional available soil water modulated by evaporative demand, based on the differential sensitivity to water stress of four key plant processes: canopy expansion, stomatal control of transpiration, canopy senescence, and HI. The HI can be modified negatively or positively, depending on stress level, timing, and canopy duration. AquaCrop uses a relatively small number of parameters (explicit and mostly intuitive) and attempts to balance simplicity, accuracy, and robustness. The model is aimed mainly at practitioner-type end-users such as those working for extension services, consulting engineers, governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and various kinds of farmers associations. It is also designed to fit the need of economists and policy specialists who use simple models for planning and scenario analysis.},

  abstract = {AquaCrop is a model of crop growth for predicting responses to various scenarios such as climates and irrigation strategies. Few studies, however, have assessed the applicability of AquaCrop for cotton under film-mulched drip irrigation in salt-affected soil. The objectives of this study were to test AquaCrop performance and to determine the appropriate irrigation amounts for cotton under several scenarios of initial soil-water content (SWC) and soil salinity for two typical soils in a saline region of southern Xinjiang of China with film-mulched drip irrigation. A four-year irrigation experiment was conducted in 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016 growing seasons for cotton, covering full (100\%), over (115 and 145\% of full) and deficit (55\textendash 90\% of full) irrigation treatments. Based on the recommended parameters for cotton in AquaCrop manual, the model was calibrated using 2016 data sets and validated using the data sets from the other three years. Simulations of canopy cover, soil water storage of the root zone and aboveground biomass fitted well with the field observations with coefficient of determination r2{$>$}0.77 and the index of agreement d{$>$}0.92 and slightly underestimated yield. As for soil salinity, the model gave a reliable simulation for less than 80\% of full irrigation treatments, while underestimated for over 80\% of full irrigation treatments. Overall, AquaCrop can be used as a feasible tool to predict cotton growth response to water under film-mulched drip irrigation in this region. According to the principle of high yield and WUE, the simulation results showed that the appropriate irrigation amounts were recommended at 358\textendash 457mm for silty loam and 406\textendash 462mm for sandy loam in this region, which can provide a reference for irrigation optimization under film-mulched drip irrigation in southern Xinjiang and other similar regions.},

  abstract = {The development and application of cropping system simulation models for cotton production has a long and rich history, beginning in the southeastern U. S. in the 1960s and now expanded to major cotton production regions globally. This paper briefly reviews the history of cotton simulation models, examines applications of the models since the turn of the century, and identifies opportunities for improving models and their use in cotton research and decision support. Cotton models reviewed include those specific to cotton (GOSSYM, Cotton2K, COTCO2, OZCOT, and CROPGRO-Cotton) and generic crop models that have been applied to cotton production (EPIC, WOFOST, SUCROS, GRAMI, CropSyst, and AquaCrop). Model application areas included crop water use and irrigation water management, nitrogen dynamics and fertilizer management, genetics and crop improvement, climatology, global climate change, precision agriculture, model integration with sensor data, economics, and classroom instruction. Generally, the literature demonstrated increased emphasis on cotton model development in the previous century and on cotton model application in the current century. Although efforts to develop cotton models have a 40-year history, no comparisons among cotton models were reported. Such efforts would be advisable as an initial step to evaluate current cotton simulation strategies. Increasingly, cotton simulation models are being applied by nontraditional crop modelers, who are not trained agronomists but wish to use the models for broad economic or life-cycle analyses. Although this trend demonstrates the growing interest in the models and their potential utility for a variety of applications, it necessitates the development of models with appropriate complexity and ease-of-use for a given application, and improved documentation and teaching materials are needed to educate potential model users. Spatial scaling issues are also increasingly prominent, as models originally developed for use at the field scale are being implemented for regional simulations over large geographic areas. Research steadily progresses toward the advanced goal of model integration with variable-rate control systems, which use real-time crop status and environmental information to spatially and temporally optimize applications of crop inputs, while also considering potential environmental impacts, resource limitations, and climate forecasts. Overall, the review demonstrates a languished effort in cotton simulation model development, but the application of existing models in a variety of research areas remains strong and continues to grow.},

  abstract = {Since the pioneering work of C.T. de Wit in the 1960s, the Wageningen group has built a tradition in developing and applying crop models. Rather than focusing on a few models, diversity is its trademark. Here we present an overview of the Wageningen crop and crop-soil modelling approaches along three criteria. The first criterion relates to the production situations the models are dealing with (i.e. potential, water and/or nutrient-limited, and actual production situations including pests, diseases and weeds). Second, models differ as a result of the objectives of model development, and hence required scale and degree of detail and comprehensiveness. Third, models have at least three potential application domains, i.e. research, education and support of learning and decision making processes. We describe both summary and more comprehensive modelling approaches for the major production situations. An overview of most of the Wageningen models is presented together with a more detailed description of LINTUL, SUCROS, ORYZA, WOFOST and INTERCOM. Illustrations for each of the three application domains are presented, i.e. plant type design, guiding experimental research, education, yield gap analysis, evaluation of manure policies, crop growth monitoring system and analysis and design of farming and regional land use systems. We discuss common issues of model verification, model validation, model validity and data requirements, and present information on software implementation, model and software documentation and distribution policy. Finally, we reflect upon the Wageningen modelling approaches and identify a number of key issues for future research. Major achievements of Wageningen modelling efforts include (1) a broad variety of approaches for modelling of systems at different scales and with different purposes; (2) their contribution to quantitative systems thinking in general, also for applications at higher hierarchical levels; (3) a strong linkage between crop modelling and higher education, both at undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral level. To continually increase our understanding of crops and production systems a diversified approach must be cherished. At the same time we conclude that focus is required on a limited number of modules in a more integrated modelling framework for the benefit of analysing, evaluating and designing cropping systems. This review may be instrumental in the development of such an integrated framework.},

It is named COTCO2 for cotton response to atmospheric CO2 concentration. The model is capable of predicting cotton crop responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations and potential concomitant changing climate variables. The major plant processes known to be influenced by CO2 are simulated explicitly, i.e. photosynthesis, photorespiration, and stomatal conductance, and its role in leaf energy balance. The model explicitly simulates the impact of atmospheric CO2 concentration on C3 photosynthesis and photorespiration at the level of carboxylation and oxygenation. Growth is simulated for individual organs, i.e. leaf blade, stem segment, taproot and lateral roots, and fruit which includes squares and bolls. Potential growth is calculated and the carbohydrate and nitrogen required to meet this potential are calculated. Actual growth is based on substrate availability, the potential growth, and water stress. Our intent here is to describe the overall structure of the model, its present status, and future development plans. Further development, documentation, calibration, and validation of the model is in progress. The long range goal of the project is to provide quantitative estimates of global cotton production in a future higher-CO2 world.}

Also, simulation of many crops is required because of the wide variety grown in the U.S. EPIC simulates all crops with one crop growth model using unique parameter values for each crop. The processes simualted include leaf interception of solar radiation; conversion to biomass; division of biomass into roots, above ground mass, and economic yield; root growth; water use; and nutrient uptake.

The FAO's AquaCrop model version 4.0 was calibrated and validated for crop canopy cover, dry aboveground biomass, soil water content and grain yield. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) for grain yield and dry aboveground biomass was 0.293 and 2.2~t~ha-1, respectively. The RMSE for the rootzone soil water content was 25~mm. The validated model was used to analyse the effect of in-season and off-season conditions on grain yield and water productivity. Grain yield and water productivity decreased (50\% for Gregory and 43\% for Livingston) with the delay in sowing date. Applying four irrigations to the mid-May sown wheat resulted in a higher (6.5, 5.7 and 5.2~t~ha-1, respectively, at 80\% exceedance probability) yield relative to the mid-April and mid-June sowing dates. Applying supplemental irrigation both in September and October resulted in a better yield (6.7 vs. 6.0~t~ha-1) and water productivity than applying irrigation only in October. The effect of off-season managements such as mulch and pre-irrigation on yield is 68\% higher in low-rainfall years that that of in the wet years.},

  abstract = {Simulation of the formation of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fiber length and strength is still an area of great uncertainty. The aim of this study was to develop a model for simulating cotton fiber length and strength formation and explaining the effect of genotype, weather (temperature and solar radiation), and crop N supply on the two indices. The duration of fiber elongation for fiber length formation and secondary wall synthesis for fiber strength formation were determined as proportional to the boll physiological developmental time (PDT), which was simulated as a function of temperature, radiation, and N. The effect of temperature and radiation on fiber length and strength was modeled as a function of the photo-thermal product (PTP), the product of thermal effectiveness and radiation. The subtending leaf N concentration per unit area of cotton boll (NA) was used as the indicator of boll N nutrition. The changes of NA with boll development, N application rate, and boll position were simulated by a semi-empirical formula. Based on the relations between the actual and critical NA, the nitrogen response functions for the formation of fiber length and strength parameters were quantified, accounting for the interactive effects of N nutrition and PTP. Calibration and validation of the model were made using fiber quality data obtained from three years with two sowing dates and three or four N application rates at three locations in China. The average RMSE and RE for cotton fiber length and strength predictions were 1.03mm and 12.4\%, 2.20cNtex-1 and 10.4\%, respectively. The proposed model well explained the observed genotypic and environmental variations in fiber length and strength formation of cotton in China.},
